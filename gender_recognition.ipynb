       "  'Text': 'So I began having migraines around the age of 13 (currently 32f) and they pretty much followed the same pattern: bright colors across my vision, the occasional partial loss of vision and those nice strobing lights, soon followed by the familiar pounding pain. No medical reason was discovered, but MRIs ruled out tumors and the like. As I got older they went from daily to monthly and then gradually stopped. I was migraine free for almost 10 years.\\n\\nThen came 2021. I had a strange migraine early this year where one of my eyes just seemed to stop working for no conceivable reason. This lasted about an hour and was not followed by pain. I saw the doctor the same day, they ruled out stroke and sent me home to rest. A few months after, I began to get migraines more similar to what I experienced when I was a teen with the added \"bonus\" of nausea/some vomiting. They have gradually grown in frequency to the point where I now have around 2 per month and they last 4-5 days without relief. I am seeing a neurologist who took an MRI and said there was nothing wrong with my brain, so she started me on 16mg Candesartan to prevent them and a triptan. I am now on my third triptan (frovatriptan, have not yet used it) because the first two (sumatriptan and rizatriptan) did not stop the migraines. \\n\\nMy concerns are this: In your experience, should a triptan stop the migraine and associated pain or do they just dull the pain a bit? I\\'m afraid my expectations of the pain stopping are unrealistic, but I\\'m not sure.  Ideally, I\\'d love for the vertigo and visual disturbances to stop too, but at this point I think that may be a lost cause. \\n\\nAlso, should I be pushing my neurologist to help me discover the underlying cause? She seems unconcerned since the MRI didn\\'t show any issues, but I feel like these migraines returning out of nowhere is a bit concerning.  I should add that now even when I am not having pain, I still see the visual disturbances near constantly and have a sensitivity to light and smell.\\n\\nHappy to provide any additional info, I\\'m almost at my wit\\'s end and could use some advice.',\n",

To me, it was a choice between my stomach and my head. I kept taking NSAIDS to treat my migraines. My stomach would absolutely kill me. It got to the point that I couldn't eat any acidic foods whatsoever. I was taking nexium and drinking bottles of liquid antacids just to be able to function. In my mind, I could function with my stomach issues but I absolutely could not function with migraines. Fast forward 10 years. I got to the point that I couldn't eat solid food. I lost over 100 pounds in a year. I lost the last 45 pounds in a month. (Full disclosure: I'm 5'11. I've always been pretty large. Normally I'm between 280 and 320 pounds. All the women on my mom's side are very large, but I digress.) On May 25, 2017 I knew my heart was in arrhythmia all day. I felt my heart skipping beats but I didn't was to worry my husband. By the time he got home at 5pm, I couldn't stand. He asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital and I emphatically said no. I began talking out of my head and not making any sense. He called 911. I was rushed to the hospital. I was down to 135 pounds. You could see every bone in my body. In the last 6 weeks before this, I could only keep down water and popsicles. They transferred me to the ICU. My potassium was so low my heart was in arrhythmia, my blood sugar was 45, and my kidneys were completely shut down. The doctor told my husband had he not forced me to go to the hospital, I would have been dead by the next morning. They had to pump me with 12 bags of potassium to get me out of the danger zone. (Potassium is like liquid fire going through your veins. To this day I have no feeling on the back of my arms.) They pumped me up with glucose. I was in the ICU for 48 hours and in the hospital 8 days that time. They put a stent in my duodenum to try to keep it open because it had closed with scar tissue from my ulcers. The stent failed after a month. They put in another one. It failed after a month. I had to check myself back into the hospital because my duodenum closed again. Finally they did a gastrojenuostomy bypass. They took the second part of my small intestine and stapled it to the back of my stomach so food could exit through there. I was in the hospital 7 days that time. It took 7 weeks to recover. I can never take NSAIDS again. I'm on maxalt for my migraines now. Please just be careful.\",\n",

No medical reason was discovered, but MRIs ruled out tumors and the like. As I got older they went from daily to monthly and then gradually stopped. I was migraine free for almost 10 years.\n",

      "Then came 2021. I had a strange migraine early this year where one of my eyes just seemed to stop working for no conceivable reason. This lasted about an hour and was not followed by pain. I saw the doctor the same day, they ruled out stroke and sent me home to rest. A few months after, I began to get migraines more similar to what I experienced when I was a teen with the added \"bonus\" of nausea/some vomiting. They have gradually grown in frequency to the point where I now have around 2 per month and they last 4-5 days without relief. I am seeing a neurologist who took an MRI and said there was nothing wrong with my brain, so she started me on 16mg Candesartan to prevent them and a triptan. I am now on my third triptan (frovatriptan, have not yet used it) because the first two (sumatriptan and rizatriptan) did not stop the migraines. \n",
      "\n",
      "My concerns are this: In your experience, should a triptan stop the migraine and associated pain or do they just dull the pain a bit? I'm afraid my expectations of the pain stopping are unrealistic, but I'm not sure.  Ideally, I'd love for the vertigo and visual disturbances to stop too, but at this point I think that may be a lost cause. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, should I be pushing my neurologist to help me discover the underlying cause? She seems unconcerned since the MRI didn't show any issues, but I feel like these migraines returning out of nowhere is a bit concerning.  I should add that now even when I am not having pain, I still see the visual disturbances near constantly and have a sensitivity to light and smell.\n",

      "How new?  I've been on propranolol for a few weeks and it seems to be working, with only the odd migraine sneaking through, but because of my medical issues, I have a history of medications initially working and then either stopping working altogether or we (my doctor and I) having to play a game of \"what dose works with the least side effects).   We've been up and down the dosage scale for both pregabalin and amitryptiline for my chronic nerve pain, and we can't increase my current amitryptiline dose (50mg) because it will cause an unwanted side effect that I wouldn't be able to live with.   Hence the propranolol for the migraines rather than increasing the amitryptiline.\n",

It's a combination of sumatriptan 85 mg and naproxen sodium 500 mg.  So far so good....you take one every 12 hours, and I've never had to take more than 2. Also, there is a migraine group on FB that has done wonders for my spirit. I've learned about supplements (magnesium is essential) and other beneficial bits of info. Come check it out. \n",

      "Benadryl was recommended to me by my neuro too, has something to do with migraineurs having high levels of histamine during an attack. Histamine causes inflammation, inflammation causes more pain, antihistamine knocks both out. I use 50 mg with a triptan if I'm going to be able to lay down and be in a semi-comatose state for the next 10 hours. It definitely helps. \n",

No side effects, except, last night during ‘me time’, was very strange. I have a complicated history with masturbation due to PTSD and really only in the last year have actually come to enjoy it, so this really sucks that I struggled to feel sensation and then when I did finally orgasm something weird kinda happened, like my whole body kinda seized up for a moment, kinda hard to explain but it was just a bit scary… I assumed this was an effect of the propranolol and I had taken it maybe an hour or two beforehand so it was pretty fresh in my system. Will my body get used to it and my sensation and orgasms return to normal?\n",

But I don't know who to blame because I also started finasteride for my hair and depending on who you ask it also has sexual side effects. Also tonight I felt like I had good erection quality, but then I also remembered that I was a few hours late on taking my pill and it had already been 24 hours. I've decided to stay on both because even though propranolol has sucked ass for migraine prevention it lowers my heart rate to normal from 112 bpm and helps my social anxiety. I even think it helped cure my dermatophagia that was probably rooted in anxiety. Botox is now my migraine prevention heavy lifter though.\n",

      "\n",
      "Background: before my infusions I was at chronic level with migraines at 20-30 a month. I tried Botox for about 2-3 years but my body could not tolerate it. I had breakthrough migraines and I would get sick with fevers and body aches/chills for 2-3 days after Botox injections. Aimovig 140mg  was a flop, tried that for 8 months with no success. I just cannot tolerate triptans. Nurtec is good. Fiorcet is also good. Daily preventative is Topamax 250mg. Works pretty good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Present day: Thanks to Vyepti I have a much greater control on my migraines. I still have them, but I’m no longer crippled by them. I feel safe enough to go out alone and not fear to be struck down with a migraine and need help. I don’t need my rescue meds at my fingertips at all times. By the half way point I did not even refill my Nurtec prescription. The last 10 days before the infusion I did need rescue meds, I could tell it was time for another round. I have stopped having my crazy types of migraines that made me think I was losing my mind. (The neurologist said he thinks I may have Alice in Wonderland migraines or whatever) those are gone. The auras and long, drug out postdromes are also a thing of the past. My migraines are shorter and more manageable. If I take Nurtec quick enough then it’s like it’s nothing at all. This may be what it is like to be a normal-ish person. It’s awesome. \n",
      "\n",
      "Long story short if you feel like you have tried everything try Vyepti. I had zero hope since I have failed every preventative and everything else really. I had no hope for this since Aimovig was such a loss. But this has done something. Maybe it’s the combo of the Nurtec and Topamax but why knock it when it’s working. And we can all use a win when we can get it!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's no trouble to share!  Someone else asked about this recently, so I'm just posting excerpts of my response below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many of us, it took years to get all of the pieces of the puzzle together! I knew I was prone to hypoglycemia long before I started having migraines - if I waited too long to eat, I would get shaky, sweaty, and feel lightheaded. I had been a vegetarian for 8 years at the point that I started having these episodes and the doctor I was working with suggested that I should consider eating meat again to make sure I was getting enough protein, so that helped for sure.  Although I was still prone to hypoglycemia if I ate something sugary, for example.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Several years later, my first pregnancy and breastfeeding seemed to further alter my metabolism. When my kiddo started to eat more solids and my hormones returned, that was the onset of migraines and I was chronic within a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connection between my blood sugar and the migraines took much, much longer to figure out, like years and years. I knew I still had episodes of hypoglycemia and that they were always accompanied by a migraine, but that only happened a few times a month and I was having migraines constantly. But eventually I figured out that I was more sensitive to blood sugar swings than was just evidenced by the obvious hypoglycemia because I saw a reduction in migraines by eating a low carb diet. Then I found Angela Stanton's theory of migraine:\n",

      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "https://www.hormonesmatter.com/migraine-metabolic-disease/\n",

      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "and it was like a lightbulb going off. It was the first time I saw someone approaching migraine as a metabolic issue and it seemed to track with everything I was experiencing. I immediately switched to a keto diet with salt supplementation and saw a dramatic reduction in my migraines. I started with strict keto, which meant staying under 20 net carbs per day (net carbs are total grams of carbohydrates minus total grams of fiber). Over time, I shifted just a bit and found that as long as I was under 40 net carbs, I wasn't triggering migraines. That worked super well for a few years.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "The final piece in my puzzle was that I was in Italy visiting family and metformin is sold over-the-counter there. My MIL, who is a medical scientist, suggested that it could help support my blood sugar control so I bought some. After trying it, I found that I could \"cheat\" my keto diet and as long as I took a low dose of metformin, I wasn't triggering migraines. I eventually had to fess up to my doctor and ask for an off-label prescription, which she was fine with writing - metformin is well tolerated, safe, and used by many, so she felt it was fine.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "So now, I do follow a full keto plan every morning when I am most prone to blood sugar swings. I have MCT oil (the most ketogenic \"food\") for breakfast, a grass-fed buttered decaf coffee several hours later, and a low carb lunch. After that, I can pretty much eat whatever I want and I take up to 750 mg of metformin each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this led me to the belief that my migraines are primarily a manifestation of a metabolic disorder.  I was probably not good at regulating electrolyte balance in my cells in the presence of glucose and the electrolyte imbalance is the migraine trigger.  I also seemed to get an incredible anti-inflammatory effect from keto, so I don't know how much that plays a role in the migraines, but it sure helped with how the rest of my body feels.  So happy to have figured this out for myself - understanding what might be causing the migraines is such an important part of getting your life back!  Good luck!  I hope the diet changes continue to help you!!!\n",

So after discussing via email, I took a dose yesterday About 2pm in my stomach.\n",

I like to take it two-three hours before I plan on going to bed so I don’t get the hangover feeling in the morning. It will probably make you feel super drowsy at night for the first week you take it, and then your body should get accustomed to it. I have nooo idea why this drug works for me, but it does. If I miss a pill now, I without a doubt get a migraine within the next few days.  And after going up to 75 mg recently, I haven’t been getting any breakthrough migraines (fingers crossed)\n",

That 500 would be a safer bet. Ugh if I had only known. \n",
      "I also spoke to my surgeon who told me to stop the antibiotic and see if my infection clears on what I already took. And that if I do end up needing more she’d prescribe something else. She didn’t want me to stop one and risk repercussions of starting it again after a hiatus\n",

      "\n",
      "If you have trouble increasing dosage due to side effects it could be an interaction with other meds. I took gabapentin and topamax and felt like an idiot- word finding was beyond difficult on both meds (it was bad enough on just topamax alone) and somnolence was worse. Thankfully the doctor agreed to remove me from that drug as it also didn’t seem to help much on its own and in combination was problematic.\n",

I currently take emgality, but it wears off 10-14 days before the next dose, and my insurance won’t approve the off label use of the 300mg injection my neurologist wants to try. Maybe a daily pill will prevent the two weeks of misery at the end of every month! \n",
      "On a related note- I take the 100mg ubrelvy made by this same company and it is one of the most magical medications I’ve ever taken. It almost always knocks the migraine out nearly completely.  I’m hoping that holds true for this new medication as well!\n",

      "So, I was recentlyy trialled on propranolol to deal with an increase in the number of migraines I was having, as well as their duration and severity.  They had also changed from \"regular\" to vestibular as well.  I'm currently on 40mg twice daily and for about a week or two I had zero migraines.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then this weekend, I wake up.and have pain only on the left side of my face, dull pressure behind my eyes, tenderness across my cheekbones and a stuffy nose.  Having previously had significant sinusitis issues in the past, I immediately think its a budding sinus infection, and begin at-home treatment, which is steam inhalation and use of a saline nadal spray.  Sinus rinses have never worked very well for me hence the nasal spray.  I spend two miserable days at home as I have Mondays off, and make an appointment with my doctor as soon as I can, which ends up being Tuesday afternoon after work.  I was shocked when he said that I had a \"sinus migraine\" which occurs when the trigeminal nerve that innervates the sinuses and nasal.passages gets irritated, and thus produces all the feelings of a sinus infection without actually having one.  It explains why I didn't recognise it as a migraine as there was no initial vertigo which is usually how my migraines announce themselves, being vestibular ones.  \n",
      "\n",
      " I take Wednesday and today (Thursday) off work as I'm feeling miserable and begin trying to get rid of the migraine by repeated doses of rizatriptan, my propranolol, and lots of rest in a dark and quiet room.  It partially works, so I call my doctor back and explain the problem, including my symptoms and that the migraine treatment is not being fully successful.  He asks if my sinuses, especially the maxillary ones along my cheekbones are still tender, and if thd tenderness is along both cheekbones or just one.  I say that both are tender, and he then says that while on Tuesday I presented as a sinus migraine, with the treatment being partially successful, and still having significant maxillary sinus tenderness, he thinks that I do have some underlying sinusitis, so he's putting me on antibiotics for ten days and that I'm to stay off work until this coming Monday.   I try arguing about that as I work.in a lab and we're really busy right now with covid testing but he says that he wants me to have time to rest while the antibiotics get to work.  Fortunately, I have PTO that I can use, and my boss is very understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "For added info, I have underlying nerve pain and central sensitisation, so my doctor and I are engaged in a neverending game of \"whack a mole\" with my nerves, as we squash the pain into submission in one area and it pops up\n",
      "in another.  My doctor thinks that the underlying nerve pain is why my migraines suddenly changed from occasional nuisances to frequent and severe debilitating horrors, and why they chsnged from regular migraines to vestibular as well.  With the new introduction of sinus migraines, should I now assume that any non-traumatic head/face pain is a migraine until proven otherwise?  I have a feeling that had I immediately used my rizatriptan on the Sunday when this began, that the migraine would have settled quicker.  It wouldn't have dealt with the sinusitis, but the sinusitis would not have been masked by the migraine either.  It's definitely going to make assessing whether its sinusitis or a migraine a lot harder, although I suppose I could just use my rizatriptan first and if thd pain responds to that then it's a migraine, if it doesn't then it's a sinus infection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I wish I was a little less unique, medically speaking.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm on 20mg of amitriptaline which I take at night - my doctor and I did discuss going up to 30mg but the upping from 10 to 20 last time made my mental health take a dive bomb, which is why its still 20mg. I also take 100mg norflex either once or twice a day, I have 8mg ondansetron and 500mg of naproxen for when a migraine does hit\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve used indica and works for me but the sativa increases headache.  I use edible gummies 10 mg.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you for sharing your experience! I think it’s an important topic. Cannabis can be helpful but definitely needs to be approached with caution. I also take antidepressants (my migraine and depression seem to be linked in that they feed each other relentlessly so treating my depression helps my migraine more than anything) and found out the hard way that taking an antidepressant and then adding cannabis, a depressant, can mix really really bad. Was in ER shortly after I had a hell of a crash after 20mg of THC during a migraine and had taken my antidepressants as usual, and spent a few days in a psychological facility and found out it’s not an uncommon experience. Beat the heck out of my thyroid too, although I’m doing a lot better now (this all happened beginning of September). So yeah, it’s a good tool in the migraine toolbox but is def not for everyone\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I started getting these knife like jabs of pain on the left side of my head (like behind my left ear but a little more up) since yesterday. I took two ibuprofens last night. I woke up today to the same damn piercing pains that come unexpectedly every 6 to 30 seconds. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to Google, these are called “ice pick headaches”. I have absolutely no idea why I am getting these. I’m not on my cycle. I’m not under any huge stress. I did get angry at significant other and still angry at him and not speaking to him. I highly doubt this is the cause. \n",
      "\n",
      "I went to bed at 3am for a couple nights over the weekend but I would sleep in the following day so it can’t be sleep deprivation. \n",
      "\n",
      "No idea why this is happening. I’m a little concerned 😟 \n",
      "\n",
      "I took 3 mg of melatonin a couple hours ago and it is doing jack shit. Still have the piercing jabs at my skull. \n",
      "\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I recently saw a neuro ophthalmologist for constant neck pain and constant visual disturbances. He said it was migraines (despite me not having any headaches) and that the neck pain was “referred pain.” He prescribed me 10mg of Nortriptyline which I’ve been taking for 5 days. For a few days now I’ve felt really dizzy, and I just had an actual migraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could the drug be causing this even though it’s supposed to prevent them?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "yeah it’s not sumatriptan. however for me it’s about as effective as 200 mg ibuprofen (ie not very effective) but better than nothing. i have had more success with tumeric (daily) and chinese medicine, but i still take the ginger\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I woke up today with \"that feeling\". Not a headache yet, but I knew one might come on...\n",
      "\n",
      "First thing today, some ginger (1/4 tsp) and water. DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. Now it's evening...I had to take 600mg ibu and put some tiger balm on...  So...seems that for my headaches, ginger doesn't do too much...\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take 500mg of ginger with a turmeric supplement at onset, if it doesn’t feel like a bad one. I’ll also drink ginger turmeric tea. If that does help within an hour, I take ibuprofen too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to take ginger daily and it caused heart palpitations, so be aware of that.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "10 years on topamax and I wouldn’t go off it. The side effects hit me hard for 2-3 months but once my body adjusted to the medication and I hit my dosage (200mg) they pretty much went away. And my neuro prepared me for everything (even some I didn’t get.) Weight loss, hair thinning (it grew back), tingling, memory loss, aphasia, brain fog, all of it I got. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m 10 years on and have some slight memory issues, definitely. And every so often I have trouble finding a word. But I’d take that over the almost daily migraines I was getting before. Now I get 1 a month.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I also have had a positive experience, been on it 10+ years and not willing to go off it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely say I got probably most of the side effects HARD in the beginning, but once I got to my dosage (200mg) and my body adjusted to the medication they pretty much went away. I have pretty light memory issues, but I had 5 migraines a week prior to the medicine and 1 a month now. So having some memory issues or light aphasia isn’t too bad of a trade (for me.)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "it’s my miracle drug. \n",
      "\n",
      "it’s taken me from unable to live a normal life, spending over 50% of my known hours with a migraine to MAYBE one or two migraine days a month. sometimes i am completely migraine free for a month. this is crazy to me, at 31, having migraines since i was 8. literally nothing else has worked for me. so. here i am. \n",
      "\n",
      "i’m on 150 mg twice daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "i had the tingly hands like many of you, at the beginning. the flat, metallic taste of carbonated beverages. \n",
      "\n",
      "i have adhd so i can’t tell you if those symptoms are made worse, honestly. i use the hell out of my reminders and calendar apps 🥲🙃\n",
      "\n",
      "i did lose some weight, but like it was mentioned a lot, i’m one of the people who also didn’t mind. ymmv on this. \n",
      "\n",
      "thought i was experiencing a small amount of hair loss, this may be due to reducing my wash cycles and also hard water in my home, monitoring the situation before making such a definitive statement one way or another.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I am a rare breed that doesn’t have side-effects on Topamax. I’ve only tested that up to 50mg though.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve been on topamax for about four years now, and my dosage is 200mg. My side effects (and why I want off of the medication, despite it helping me):\n",
      "- weight loss initially, then weight gain. - tingling in all my extremities- I’ve had issues with brain fog and ongoing depression despite being treated for it, so I want to be off of it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don't get anything, at first some tingling in hands but that's it, it went away like a month or so later. I went from 26 attacks at month to 5-6, I'm on 25 mg because I'm petite and I can't tolerate higher doses of any meds.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been taking a 50 mg dose for over a year. The side effects were worse the first couple of months. I experienced cold hands and feet and loss of appetite. I've noticed no mental fog or memory issues. However, my migraines were causing me similar problems. My extremities are still cold, but wearing socks fixes it. Overall, the side effects are minor to me, and I have almost no migraines, so it's worth it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is almost exactly what I went through. I was at 125mg when I stopped and told my neuro I couldn't handle it anymore. I was down to 1-3 migraines a month, but it wasn't worth it. That and the overheating just made me miserable.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not exactly Topamax but I've been on Trokendi XR (same active drug) for about 2 years now. Aside from a little tingling in my fingers as I ramped up on the drug, it has not been bad. When I was at 100mg, I had a little urgency when I had to poop, but that was all. I'm at 50mg now and don't have any of that. My doc seems to like the Trokendi over the Topamax bc she said she sees less issues.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been on it for the past two months. Apart from the numbness in my hands sometimes and lack of taste in some food like carbonated stuff and sometimes spice for me, things have been okay surprisingly. I was also worried about the effect it may have on my mental health, but since starting it I finally got the proper help in a psychiatrist and therapist so if there has been any effect on my mental health/ cognition don't think I could definitively say that it was from the topamax (I have severe depression with a lot of brain fog and some dissociation). \n",
      "\n",
      "I was terrified of taking it, you could even check my post history, but so far not bad. It's brought down my nearly daily migraines to twice a week so I'd say it's helping. Most important thing is to go with an open mind and don't be afraid to stop if you feel uncomfortable! I was titrated up to 100 mg very slowly, from 12.5mg, to 25mg, to 50 mg  up to 100 very recently in this time. If I don't have any side effects that are unbearable, I might stay on it for a year or so as long as no new side effects appear and it keeps me down to 8 migraines that can actually be effectively treated with ubrelvy vs. damn near daily migraines that laugh at cgrp's.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve been on 50 mg/day for several, like 3ish, years with a lot of success. I still get headaches a few times a month  (always have), but they’re minor and totally manageable now. \n",
      "\n",
      "I did notice, particularly at first, that my memory recall wasn’t as sharp and I just felt like, dumber? Idk. It’s hard to quantify. I also smoke a bunch of weed and started taking the meds after quitting drinking, so my brain isn’t exactly in tip-top shape. I also suffered some brain injuries as a child, and I wonder how much of that comes into play as a cause of my migraines or something. Anyway. I still experience some numbness in my hands occasionally, but this really only happens if I don’t eat enough! Topamax hasn’t had a huge effect on my appetite, but I suspect it helped when I started it and a diet at the same time after getting sober. I don’t think I ever want to increase the dose if I can help it, though. I’m going to see a neurologist if it stops being effective based on some of the things I’ve heard about higher dosing.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm on 150mg, I was having 4 migraines a week now having 1-2 fortnightly so a big improvement for me. The main side effect for me that not many people have mentioned is diarrhea. Apologies for being graphic, but it is pretty bad and I'm glad I work from home mostly while I've been taking it. There have definitely been sudden and quick dashes to the toilet. Had I not been home I would have had an accident. I have not mentioned this side effect to my doctor as for me, while I'm working from home, it's been worth it. I've tried other drugs and this is currently working for me. I don't have it in me to reduce and try something else right now. The other side effect is a reduced appetite, a little. Some minor tingling in my fingers. I can't really say if I get brain fog, I don't feel I work as quick as I used to pre getting migraines, but can't tell if its a side effect of the medication. I've lost 18lbs\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take 100mg a day. I had the tingles at first. Maybe itchiness? It does decrease appetite and maybe some things taste off but I just eat other things, no big deal. I have other mental health conditions so it’s hard to say if it has had any effect on me emotionally. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I do experience brain fog which is frustrating at times. I just find work around words or ways to explain things. I went from constant daily excruciating migraines to maybe a handful. 12 migraines during my worst months, which my triptans handle pretty well. So some brain fog I can deal with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like someone else said, people happy with their treatment don’t really post about it. I don’t often feel compelled to talk about my experience with Topamax which has generally been uneventful and effective.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Topamax is the only preventative that I've been able to tolerate. Everything else gave me really horrific side effects. I'm on 175mg/day but my side effects are actually relatively mild. Occasional tingling in hands/feet, occasional memory loss, occasional changes in taste. The biggest side effect I've had is loss of appetite/weight loss but nutrition shakes keep me from losing too much weight. I haven't had amazing results but it definitely has helped.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Topomax was the worst drug I have ever been on.  Brain fog, including resulting in a car accident and impacting my grades my senior year of college.  Walking down 6 flights of stairs and realizing I'd only meant to go down one.  Mood swings, depression, sobbing every day after work.  Carbonated beverages tasted flat, huge appetite swings leading to poor nutrition.  Just being a miserable wreck.  I was on 100mg and got off it, then another doctor told me the problem was the dosage and tried 25mg, and that was still a problem.  It didn't have much impact on my migraines either.  On the list of side effects is \"cognitive disfunction\" - literally, your brain does not work.  Never again.  My doctor tells me that I have tried every class of migraine drugs that exists, and this was the worst.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Mines very similar with regards to the side effects. The migraines haven’t improved as much with just the topiramate though and I’m now on candesartan too. (I take 100mg topiramate twice a day).\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "When I took 25 mg, I had no side effects. It was amazing. When I bumped up to 50 mg, I got hand numbness, so I went back down. It worked great for me.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had issues with carbonated beverages for awhile, but that’s either gone away or I forgot. \n",
      "\n",
      "I haven’t lost my appetite or any weight. \n",
      " \n",
      "Occasionally I get paresthesia, tingling in my fingers, which goes away quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s it. I had a huge reduction in migraines within the first few months of starting. I’ve been on 100 mg/day for seven years. A couple things that might have helped: 1) I was titrated up in dose. I started at 25 mg/day for a bit before the dose was increased. This let my body adjust. 2) I take it at night, per my doctor’s recommendation. I think topiramate makes me a little sleepy within the first couple of hours, so taking it before bed gets rid of that potential issue.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure. 100 mg\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Have been on it for more than 2 years now, previously had chronic migraines at least 1-2x per week. When I was started on it I had the worst side effects and felt it didn’t make a difference to my migraines at all; was so fatigued, completely lost my appetite, felt really unwell for about 2 weeks. Eventually was convinced to continue with topamax and was upped to 100mg per day; side effects slowly lessened. Migraines definitely improved after about 3 months, decreased to about once or twice a month which was a huge difference for me. I’m on 150 mg now, and have still got side effects from it (brain fog, tiredness, poorer concentration) but they’ve definitely improved over time, but I would still take the side effects over what it was. I’ve heard of a lot of people who have done well on topamax, but lots of others who have also hated it, so I think it’s really hard to say how it would affect you / how much it would help your migraines. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’d suggest if you’re willing to risk the side effects, try it for a couple months and see how it goes, obviously guided by your doctor. Good luck!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been on it for close to 2 years at this point and have had almost zero side effects. \n",
      "I do fairly analytical work (electrical engineering) as well and have not noticed any cognitive effects.\n",
      "At one point I was up to 175mg a day.\n",
      "Currently tapering off of it because it seems to have lost it's effectiveness (at helping with migraines).\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take 75mg a day, my biggest side effect is pins and needles in hands and feet, which has caused me a few injuries. I do get reduced appetite sometimes, but more often I just get full faster. The other thing that wasn't really a big thing for me, but might matter to others is that it gave me hyperpigmentation on my forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I can't drink soda anymore, it taste gross, like really flat.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm currently on 75mg/day dose and I have no side effects at all. I'll be increasing my dose to 100mg/day, and I hope it will stay this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had migraines twice a month (lasting 2 days every time), now I have them mostly during my periods, or when the barometric pressure is low and I want to eliminate them too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty terrified when I saw the list of side effects, and also when I've seen the bad opinions. But the thing is- people who are happy with their treatments rarely write opinions online, right? Like, how many times you see good reviews of meds? How many times you yourself went online and wrote a positive comment on a medicine that helped you beat a bad cold or something? I personally never done that. But when syrup for cough have me tummy ache I was loud about how crappy it was!\n",
      "\n",
      "People go and write reviews when it doesn't work and they need to release their frustration (which is understandable), not when it does. That's why reviews online may be biased. It's better not to read them and stay positive.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ha!  You make a very valid point..I failed to say that it’s 30 mg extended release flexeril.\n",

      "30mg flexeril?! How do you function?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Wow! This seems like something I could benefit from. I’ve been getting monthly occipital trigger point injections for over 2 years as well as taking 30 mg Flexeril daily. It doesn’t eliminate all the pain or stop all my migraines so it’s not a 100% success imo. My Neurologist has never mentioned anything about an implanted device so I’m very curious about this topic.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Awesome, no one told me, I used to take multiple 100mg pills almost every day for at least a year 🙃 am now not taking it as often, but still at least once a week. Haven't had any symptoms assocciated with chest area, just weird feeling in my face and legs. Aaand I have AVM in my brain, so cool cool...\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you so much for your feedback my neurologist started me on amitryptaline kept increasing till 50mg started to work abit but I think I need larger dose he also started me on candesartan (blood pressure tablet) he said if doesn’t work he will do Botox. \n",

      "Have you tried Botox? Any feedback?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, since that last major one in November last year I've been on 12.5mg a day of Amitriptyline. I've also gotten Novaminsolfun for the headache and Metoclopramide for the ability to not instantly throw up the Novaminsulfon, in case a migraine hits.\n",
      "\n",

      "I think I may have experienced my first true migraine yesterday but I want to put my feelers out before getting checked out by a doctor. I’m extremely hesitant to go to urgent care or doctor visits right now due to Covid cases being high in my area. I feel like if I can confirm that my symptoms are fairly common I don’t have to put myself through the anxiety of an office visit and can instead focus on treating the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a timeline of what happened:\n",
      "\n",
      "6am - I had a horrible time trying to sleep all night and when my boyfriend left for the day I began to feel nauseous. I drank some orange juice, felt better, and went back to sleep until 8am.\n",
      "\n",
      "8am - I woke up again and got ready for work and I felt fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "2pm - I began to feel a headache coming on while I was working my retail job and on my break I went for coffee and cigarettes and a donut in the hopes they will prevent the headache from worsening. Shortly after eating I took 800mg of ibuprofen and in the next hour my headache became much more intense and concentrated to one area; above my right eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "4pm - My headache was fairly severe at this point, but the rest of me felt fine. I finished my coffee and sat in our breakroom with an ice pack over the painful part of my head and that seemed to make the pain worse; it felt like I had been punched in the temple. Two older and wiser coworkers asked me what I was experiencing and when I described it they both told me it sounded like a migraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "7:30pm - I finished my shift and my headache was still quite painful. At certain points during the last few hours of work, using the cash registers became difficult for me due to intense shaking in my whole body and feeling sort of confused. I know our POS like the back of my hand and I was struggling to get through transactions all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "8pm - I got home, chugged two bottles of water and ate a packet of Ready Rice. My mom instructed me to take 2 ibuprofen, 2 tylenol, and 2 benadryl, as the my right ear had begun to feel kind of like it had a balloon inside of it. Miraculously after a few hours the pain went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "2:30am - So now it is 2:30 in the morning and I've had another night of extremely poor rest and my head feels fine, but my stomach is a hot mess. I feel bloated, and hungry, and nauseated at the same time.

      "I’ve had chronic headaches for 7 years - theyre pretty eclectic, so to speak: icepick, tension, cluster... I was initially told they weren’t migraines but given something, I think gabapentin, and switched to something else after about six months. I’ve tried all the usual drugs, but in 2017 a new neurologist diagnosed me with migraines without aura and prescribed topamax- I got up to 200mg, which worked well and I didn’t see side effects. Unlike anything else I tried, it seemed to keep working more than a few months- but last year, the headaches got worse and different. I started having visual symptoms (flashes of light, thinking I see bugs, shifting items in the periphery) and increased light sensitivity. My neurologist prescribed Ajovy in March and I’ve been on it since then, but it doesn’t seem to work. \n",

      "So I saw a new neurologist who says the best options are to take a lower dose of topamax and switch to either emgality, Aimovig, or Botox. I’m looking into the cost of all of them with my insurance but assuming there’s no major difference, does anyone have experience with switching to any of the above from Ajovy? Or trying any with Topamax? Any thoughts are welcome- thanks.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Magnesium is central to numerous physiological functions, and the role it plays in the various aspects of migraine pathogenesis is well described. Although some studies have shown an association between migraines and magnesium deficiency, it is difficult to assess this with routine blood testing and serum magnesium levels are a poor reflection of body stores of the cation. Therefore, treatment should be based on clinical suspicion, with both oral and intravenous magnesium available as simple, safe, inexpensive and well-tolerated options for the management of migraines. In patients with symptoms suggestive of hypomagnesemia such as pre- menstrual syndrome, cold extremities and foot or leg cramps, we suggest daily magnesium supplementation with 400mg of chelated magnesium, magnesium oxide or slow-release magnesium. While some patients may require doses of up to 1000mg, diarrhoea and abdominal pain may be limiting factors. Intravenous magnesium may be used in patients who are unable to tolerate or absorb oral magnesium or who are non-compliant with daily dosing. It may also be used for the treatment of acute migraines, or as a monthly prophylactic infusion, often administered premenstrually.”\n",

      "Seems to help if taking big ammounts. I used to take about 600 mg of different kinds. Heard someone take double of that. It is quite cheap so just try. On the other hand triptane are to be taken  wisely only when u have no other choice as they may cause over sensitivity. Feel good\n",

I used to have a migraine 24/7 with no relief (mostly VM symptoms) before taking the meds and supplements.  Now I still get migraines every day but I get maybe half of my day without one. Worse in high-stimulation environments such as lots of sound and light but it got me to the point where I could go to work again part time. \n",

If you had bad reactions to SSRIs, try starting really low on any other serotonin-affecting medication as you might have a common genetic condition where this kind of medication is not cleared as fast from your body and you might need lower doses.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've been taking nortriptyline since 2007. I'm on 25 mg right now but at one point I was taking 75 mg. It never made me very sleepy. Maybe at first. I actually feel quite energized from it. I think it's great for depression because it's so activating (to me anyway). It's definitely helped my neck and migraine pain.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm currently on 50mg of Nortriptyline. Everyone has different experiences with different preventative medicines so going through a few types is normal until you find one that helps you and you can tolerate the side effects. I can't get out of bed when I have a bad migraine so I can't believe someone would be judgy about trying to prevent them, especially if they know what it is like. Other than the drowsiness from it, the other side effects (dry mouth) has reduced over time for me. Unfortunately, like all my preventative experiences, initially it seemed to be working great but after about a month on the full dosage it seems to be losing its effectiveness. Hopefully next on my list will be the CGRP injections which are a relatively new medicine for migraines and they seem to have the best feedback.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hey, OP! So your medication history sounds somewhat similar to mine. In addition to the SNRIs Cymbalta and Effexor, I was also tried on various SSRIs in the past for depression (Prozac, Lexapro, etc) and I pretty universally hated them. They never helped my depression and always gave me different weird side effects. I also tried Topamax for migraines and it made me feel forgetful and out of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few months ago I started on 25 mg Amitriptyline, which is in the same medication class as the Nortriptyline you’re trying now. I don’t have enough good things to say about it! My migraines have been reduced from weekly and pretty intense to maybe twice a month and a 2-3 on the pain scale. I sleep like a baby every night, which has not always been easy for me. The only bad effect I experience is increased thirst, which is manageable with some extra water and breath mints. \n",
      "\n",
      "Give it a fair shake — I’d say give it at least a few weeks to a month as long as you aren’t experiencing side effects — and try not to worry about your husband. I think, especially for men, there’s sometimes this feeling that you’re stronger if you make yourself suffer through pain without medicating it. That’s nonsense. All that does is make you miserable. Maybe he’ll be more open to medication options if he sees one working for you.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah no idea! 😅 The sumatriptan has helped like 80/90% of the time. There has only been one migraine where I took it &amp; it didn't help at all. The rest of the times I have taken it it's usually helped by the time I have taken a second dose. I can take up to 4 doses (200 mg total) but usually don't have to take more than twice before it starts to help.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have been on Nortriptyline for two years and love it!  I’m on 30mg and my migraines went from daily to about 10 a month.  I added the shot Aimovig and now I’m down to 3.  It took me a few months to really settle into the Notriptyline and get past the side effects.  I take it before bedtime and it really helps me sleep so much better (the initial grogginess will stop). \n",
      "\n",
      "Also sumatriptan is a great addition for instant relief if you take it when you feel the migraine coming on.  Since you’ve tried multiple medications you should be eligible for your insurance to cover Aimovig or Emgality so consider those with your doctor if you don’t like the current meds.   It can be tough finding the right combo of meds but I’m so happy to see that you are committed to trying because it’s not worth sitting back and suffering like your husband.\n",

      "Hi all! Just wondering if anyone has any experience of anxiety and OCD being worsened by topiramate/topamax?\n",
      "\n",
      "Background: I had severe OCD from the age of \\~7 to \\~23. Due to a mixture of medication and therapy, I recovered in 2019. I've now come off most of my OCD meds (just on a very low dose of SSRIs) and I haven't really had OCD symptoms for three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of weeks ago, I went to the doctor about headaches and nausea I was getting most days and he said he thought it was migraines and prescribed me topiramate/topamax (25mg the first week and then increasing to 50mg). The first week, I felt incredibly anxious and kept waking up in the middle of the night worrying about really strange things but then it went away. When I increased the dose, a similar thing happened and OCD symptoms came back again for the first time in three years and I keep have intrusive thoughts and wanting to do compulsions. It's quite scary because not having OCD has changed my life and I really really don't want to go back to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some stressful things happening in my life at the moment so there's a chance it's not this medication but it feels very correlated timing-wise. Also I've had stressful times in the last 3 years but I have never had the OCD return until now - it feels like I've gone slightly mad :(\n",
      "\n",
      "Annoyingly, it has made the headaches and nausea better but it wouldn't be worth having OCD again.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Also bipolar, also made me hypomanic - And I’ll add, BUT AT A CERTAIN DOSE. My psychiatrist was wary of me taking it at all because of how intense the psychological side effects can be, but it’s the only thing that helps with my headaches. At 25mg I have no side effects and it’s all good. At 50mg I’m borderline psychotic. It’s a very fine line and dangerous, but it’s worth it for me personally. I have my psychiatrist monitoring it really closely. But yes, it’s notorious for intense psychiatric side effects.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So the amitriptyline I’ve been on for years has stopped working and my doctor wants me to try a few things before being referred again to a neurologist. The first I decided to try was topiramate as most of my symptoms are neurological (flashing lights, light and noise sensitivity, vertigo and nausea, etc). My migraine frequency is more than 15 a month, honestly it’s almost every day and usually it’s without headache but the past few months has been with headache which is hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really wanted topiramate to work and it would for a few days at each dose but then I think seemed to wear off? I didn’t really get any side effects at 25mg or 50mg and I was at 50mg for nearly 3 weeks actually but I recently upped to 75mg and it scared me. I live alone and I started experiencing seizures and identity disturbance (I have a well managed dissociative disorder but this was messing me up after years of hard work) and whilst the migraines went away they came back quickly again and I think somehow they seemed worse than before?\n",
      "\n",
      "So I’m coming off of it now, my doc wants me to remain at 50mg for a while whilst he tries me on propranolol instead (I’m still on the amitriptyline 30mg for reference) to see if all three together at a low dose will help and then go down to 25mg of the topiramate. Tbh I don’t think the topiramate is doing anything at all and will be glad to get off it but we’ll see.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "See I wonder because what I experience is very extreme, I’m actually watching YouTube videos now and it’s exactly like those. Like I feel them and it happens specifically during an aura now that I think about it, they always happen right after the visual aura hits me. Is it possible it’s some kind of vestibular aura? I don’t know. I wish I had a neurologist to speak to. I also hope you find something that works for you. For reference I didn’t have any side effects really at 25mg or 50mg, minus some tingling hands, so I thought I’d be okay at 75mg too. It was scary how quickly the effects suddenly hit me. If you live alone, I’d say don’t be afraid to try it, but first sign of noticing anything weird, get off it. I got off it three days after I upped the dose. First day I felt good. Second day I had one seizure, one drop attack and one instance of forgetting who I was. Third day I had two seizures, more drop attacks than fingers, many dissociative episodes, and I spent the rest of the day focusing on all my coping mechanisms to make sure I wouldn’t forget myself. I knew then I had to stop the next morning’s dose. Today would’ve been day four and I have had nothing except being extremely exhausted and spaced out. If I hadn’t have stopped - who knows.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Did you ever have suicidal ideation before, like was it something that was dredged out of your brain like it was for me or was it just new and terrifying? Like I’ve had seizures before, I was diagnosed with dissociative non-epileptic attacks so I think that’s what was happening, I have had them well under control for years but yesterday I had many in a row and I was struggling to control them. I didn’t take my topiramate dose this morning and no seizures or drop attacks but still so very sluggish, I didn’t realise I was also experiencing that alongside all the other symptoms. But I suppose seizures are exhausting. \n",
      "\n",
      "So actually that’s one thing I’m worried about taking propranolol alongside the topiramate, is the exhaustion. I do also suffer from orthostatic intolerance due to adrenal insufficiency and have a history of syncope and that is making me nervous. I think I remember the doctor saying he’s prescribing me 80mg of propranolol but I’m wondering if I should start at half that dose first? I have a pill cutter I can use. \n",
      "\n",
      "The side effects of medications in general are definitely problematic. I was hoping to get off amitriptyline this year and here I am going on more meds instead. I think it’s why the lowest dose is always best. Just always difficult finding what works. The doc said if the propranolol doesn’t work out for me they have other options. I hope they just send me to a neurologist again like I first asked tbh. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you find another source of relief now you’ve had to come off the propranolol and I hope you manage to come off that completely without issue.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sorry I can't remember the Topimax dose, it was years ago. The nausea was constant. The range of side effects for these kinds of drugs is brutal. I didn't get emotional like crying or depression, just an uncontrollable urge to kill myself accompanied by intrusive and racing thoughts with a total numbness to any emotions. It was like nothing I was on before. If I didn't know as much about big pharma as I do I would be surprised anyone was prescribed drugs like that. I mean, it's a medication that is prescribed to control seizures and it was causing seizures in you. That's so unsafe.\n",
      "\n",
      "My maintenance dose of nadolol was 80 mg and my propranolol was 40mg (not at the same time). I actually liked these medications at first. It reduced the occurrence of migraines and my anxiety as well, which was a nice bonus. But  I was sluggish and overly tired and my asthma became unmanageable. It's more important that I'm able to breathe than be migraine free, so I'm coming off it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a beta blocker, my heart rate would never go over 95 regardless of how hard I was working out and my blood pressure was always too low. Add in asthma and I've got a dangerous combo on my hands because I have POTS and I surf/dive in the ocean. On the annoying side, my apple watch never once acknowledged my 'workouts' even though beta blockers are a medication it adjusts for. On the dangerous side, coming off it is worse than benzo tolerance withdrawal. No one warns us of the hell we go through when we reduce and then stop a medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I could have continued it and didn't have side effects that would have been great. It's the best medication I've been on for my migraines. But messing with my heart and my ability to breathe was a dealbreaker. I hope you have a better outcome than me. I'm so frustrated that I've been dealing with migraines for decades and all the options thrown at me just cause the rest of my health to tank. Good luck with your path forward. We all react to meds differently, so hopefully your next steps work for you :)\n",

      "When I first dealing with neck pain triggered headaches, I used flexeril cyclobenzaprine plus sleep to kick me out of a multi-day headache cycle.  Low dose, 10 mg.  Even low dose amitryptyline.  They both made me sleepy.\n",
      "\n",

For me I just felt a little awkward for like 7 to 10 days after stopping then really had no ill effects from stopping after that. Absolutely don't stop without a doc's permission but you could always talk to your doc about that. I'm wishing you well. Nortrip definitely controlled and masked my pain and I kinda miss that a lil.\n",

I was because my insomnia was so bad and it was making me anxious about potential migraines. It was a vicious cycle so I’d take like 10mg or 5mg of melatonin. I realize that’s not typical at all, but thought I’d just let it be know. Pain killer avoidance one of the most annoying things migraine suffers have to do\n",

The past two mornings I have had hallucinations when waking up in the morning. Like, I open my eyes, and I am groggy still, and I just see a person standing in my room. Today it was a young man, dressed in a white tank top and jeans holding a baby. Super weird! I just sort of rub my eyes like Scooby Doo would and it goes away. Has anyone else experienced this? I see that hallucinations are a potential side effect, but that it is rare and mostly in patients that have dementia who take this medicine at much higher doses. I am not sure if it's just lack of sleep or if it's meds. I also take 1/2 a unisom and zoloft before bed, but I have never had this type of side effect with those pills. It's freaking me out bc it's two mornings in a row. \n",

      "Like many of us, it took years to get all of the pieces of the puzzle together!  I knew I was prone to hypoglycemia long before I started having migraines - if I waited too long to eat, I would get shaky, sweaty, and feel lightheaded.  I think what happened was that several years later, my first pregnancy and breastfeeding further altered my metabolism.  When my kiddo started to eat more solids and my hormones returned, that was the onset of migraines and I was chronic within a month.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Early on in my treatment, we found out that I did have a pretty significant menstrual migraine and my doctor immediately put me on continuous-dose birth control.  That complete suppression of my cycle fixed the hormone trigger for me and, with the exception of having a second child, my cycle has been completely suppressed for almost 18 years now.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The connection between my blood sugar and the migraines took much, much longer to figure out, like years and years.  I knew I still had episodes of hypoglycemia and that they were always accompanied by a migraine, but that only happened a few times a month and I was having migraines constantly.  But eventually I figured out that I was more sensitive to blood sugar swings than was just evidenced by the obvious hypoglycemia because I saw a reduction in migraines by eating a low carb diet.  Then I found this:\n",

      "\n",
      "And it was like a lightbulb going off.  It was the first time I saw someone approaching migraine as a metabolic issue and it seemed to track with everything I was experiencing.  I immediately switched to a keto diet with salt supplementation and saw a dramatic reduction in my migraines.  I started with strict keto, which meant staying under 20 net carbs per day (net carbs are total grams of carbohydrates minus total grams of fiber).  Over time, I shifted just a bit and found that as long as I was under 40 net carbs, I wasn't triggering migraines.  That worked super well for a few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final piece in my puzzle was that I was in Italy visiting family and metformin is sold over-the-counter there.  My MIL, who is a medical scientist, suggested that it could help support my blood sugar control so I bought some.  After trying it, I found that I could \"cheat\" my keto diet and as long as I took a low dose of metformin, I wasn't triggering migraines.  I eventually had to fess up to my doctor and ask for an off-label prescription, which she was fine with writing - metformin is well tolerated, safe, and used by many, so she felt it was fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, I do follow a full keto plan every morning when I am most prone to blood sugar swings.  I have MCT oil (the most ketogenic \"food\") for breakfast, a grass-fed buttered decaf coffee several hours later, and a low carb lunch.  After that, I can pretty much eat whatever I want and I take up to 750 mg of metformin each day.  \n",

      "I am writing from the other side!  17 years ago, I started getting migraines and within a month, I was chronic.  For 12 years, I had 16-18 migraine days every month.  For years, I was a patient at a major medical center's headache clinic.  I tried SO many treatments, then, almost 6 years ago, I finally found a treatment plan that works for me.  I do still get migraines, but everything is under control, meaning I know why I get the ones I get, I medicate early with my abortives and really never get to full blown migraine anymore.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My primary triggers are hormones and blood sugar swings, my secondary triggers include exercise/getting overheated, changing times when I eat/sleep/changing time zones, airplane pressure, barometric pressure changes, rebound from Ibuprofen/Zomig, some chocolates, all alcohol, and MSG.\n",
      "\n",
      "My preventative therapies are 3:  1. Botox, which I get every 5 months, 2. a modified keto diet (to address the reactive hypoglycemia that triggers SO many of my migraines) that includes the use of metformin, and 3. continuous-dose birth control to completely suppress my cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also take the usual supplements (magnesium, CoQ10, B2), and do a fair amount of lifestyle stuff to avoid triggers (eating and sleeping at the exact same times every day).\n",
      "\n",
      "My abortive therapies are zomig+800mg ibuprofen, which I can take up to twice each day and for up to 3 consecutive days. Day 4, ibuprofen only, and Day 5 nothing - this is to address my rebound tendencies.\n",

      "It's been a long journey, but because I stuck with my doctors and kept trying things until we found the combo that works for me.

      "Overall, the doc I have with Cove is very receptive to my messages, and the prices aren’t bad. I think I pay $84/q 3 mo for my meds and that’s for 3 different meds so it isn’t bad at all.

I take it at the first twinge in my brow bone, long before I feel pain - with this timing, I feel better in about 35-45 minutes and never have a full blown migraine.  If you take it after the migraine is in full swing, it may not be effective.  See the link below for more info, but the max dose is 10mg per day:https://www.drugs.com/dosage/zolmitriptan.html\n",

This is designed to have the same effect as the monthly dose and the FDA approved it because it should have the same effect as the monthly dose. Some people just prefer the quarterly dosing for patient compliance and other factors.\n",

So yeah if the pot doesn’t seem to help with pain and just makes you chill and you’re on anti-depressants, it’s not worth keep doing pot like I did.

As one of the other users indicated, it’s usually a steroid taper where you start out at a higher dose and take progressively less - for example, 60 mg of prednisone day 1, 50 mg day 2, down to 10 mg on day 6. It may be prescribed as a blister pack or just as a bottle of tablets, either way is fine.\n",

Three, it may make it difficult to sleep, so taking it in the morning may be better and your doctor can prescribe a sleep aid if needed. Four, steroids do suppress your immune system to some extent so I would make sure you are masking up even if vaccinated (although I think most of us do that even when not on steroids).\n",

Went on my evening jog, and came back with more persistent headache on one side in the back of my head. I feel around my neck, and find a sore spot at the base of the skull behind the ear on that side. I think it is either a lymph node, or a injured tissue causing a tension headache. Overnight the pain begins to throb painfully, interfering with sleep. Turning my head to certain positions seems to help, as does elevating it on several pillows. Pain encompasses upper neck and skull (rear left). \n",

Go into bed and rest throughout the evening. As I get up a few times, no headache but now I have very disturbed vision, with inability to focus.

Ok at least he tried but I should have been on preventives long before that.

Unless you have some kind of health condition precluding you taking triptans, there is no reason not to refill them. If I were you I'd switch docs, or consider asking another doc you see to give you a better rx. Or if you like the doc otherwise and want to stick with her, just be super clear with her: you get relief from these drugs, you need them, when doc refuses or neglects to fill them she is depriving you of your effective treatment.

      "Yes, Emgality recently stopped working for me after ~5 months of taking it. I kinda knew it was going to happen but I did not think it was going to happen so quickly. Previous to Emgality, Aimovig had been effective for me for almost 2 yrs before it stopped working. I’m currently doing a washout period before whatever the next CGRP-inhibitor that my neurologist decides upon that my health insurance will cover. The washout period is going poorly &amp; I don’t think I’ve experienced the worst of it yet.\n",
      "Funny that you should mention feeling like you did one of the injections wrong. I felt the exact way when Emgality stopped working for me. I was taking the cluster headache dosage every month, consisting of 3 manual syringe injections of 100mg/1mL each. The reason I mention this detail is because they seemed a good deal easier to screw up than the auto-injectors that I had gotten used to with Aimovig. I wasn’t screwing them up, the medication just wasn’t working as well anymore, which became more &amp; more evident with each month.\n",
      "I’d suggest contacting your neurologist to look into where your treatment might need to go next. In the meantime, it probably isn’t going to make your situation worse to continue with taking Emgality until something else is figured out. In my migraine experience so far, by the time you’re taking CGRP-inhibitors, you probably don’t have a lot of other migraine treatment options that haven’t been considered yet. In doing this, you could probably rule out an injection/administration issue as well as any effect that Topamax change is having on your migraine activity (assuming there are no further changes with the Topamax).\n",
      "Sorry for the long-winded reply that is probably chock full of typos. My head is really hurting now, making words rather difficult to express concisely.

It's probably different for everyone though, and I was only taking maximum 25mg, and for the first few years only 10mg.  If you were to experience massive weight gain from it then I'd suggest maybe it's not the right drug for you to be taking at all, but surely worth a try.

To be honest the Maxalt only works about half the time. I usually also have to take 400mg advil along with it to have any effect (which is probably a horrible idea). I think the Aimovig was the icing on the cake and the cherry on top! It's amazing. It's supposed to be a monthly injection, but my neurologist told me to take it every 25ish days because it does start to wear off before 30 days.\n",

Since the occurrence of these  migraines was just once in a year or so,  it hadn't  bothered  me much up till recently. I used  to take off for a couple of days after  the  attack. I don't  what  exactly  was the trigger- stress or  some kind of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Couple  months  before,  I got my usual once in a year kind of migraine. I went through  the usual  ordeal. On the one week anniversary  when  I thought  I was  getting fine, for the first  time  in my life  I got a second  consecutive  migraine with aura after a week of the first migraine attack. My life has been  terrible  after that. I got blurred vision and severe photophobia after that. At one point I got scared  that my vision impairment  was permanent  and went to the ER twice. Then I went to a neurologist  and he ordered an MRI to rule out  migraine stroke. The MRI result  turned  out to be all fine. The diagnosis  was migranosus  status. I have been having constant   intractable  headache for the last two months  and my headache  hasn't  gone away yet. I have been having  photophobia with  blurred  vision.  My symptoms  have gotten  better in course  of time but still I have  photophobia  and  vision  issues when I look at a computer  and such. My neurologist  has made me try indomethacin, propranolol, nurtec  , eletriptan, one 6 day course  of a steroid - dexamethasone, Ajovy injection etc and none seemed to provide  me any immediate  relief.  I am still continuing propranolol 20 mg three times a day and eletriptan when the headache is a little unbearable. I still haven't  returned  to work  yet. My job involves  constantly looking at computers and I have  to get back to work soon. I have constant  pain behind  my eyes (mostly left eye)  when  I try to read something\n",
      "\n",
      "So friends,  help me out if you have had a similar  migraine  type and what has helped  for you\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yep, it's very expensive. I'm on Medicaid and needed special prior authorization to get it covered. And I'm extremely lucky they decided to cover it, because cash price is over $1K for ten 100mg pills.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I would say yes but I also got my daith pierced around the same time. But I did notice a huge difference once I started both. I was on 10 mg of amitriptyline for 3 years and then last year I was getting them bad again so my doc went to 25mg. I did try topamax and I could not handle that at all. I had horrible tummy issues and just being on it for 3 days the withdrawal was the worst migraine. So now it’s listed as an allergy on my record. My migraines was 4 days and I couldn’t even work first thing in the morning and the pain was a level 5. Now my length is about 2 days and level pain is a 2.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I find I definitely need that second dose of sumatriptan. If it’s really bad I will take the full 100mg twice in a day with 2 hours between doses, but I try to remain cautious pushing the dose because I’m on an antidepressant as well. Even though serotonin syndrome is rare, I still don’t want to experience that. Do you find that the longer acting triptans like frovatriptan or naratriptan still work quickly? It seems as though their onset of action is slower compared to the fast acting triptans. I feel like with my migraines time is really of the essence so the faster I can stop a migraine in its tracks before it reaches the pain stage the better.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "26f here if it matters. For about four days now I have had intense vertigo and nausea. Sometimes I feel like I'm getting the beginning of a headache but it's absolutely not like my usual migraines. In the past, my normal migraines give me a whole bunch of aura symptoms before they start, and then usually go away overnight. I've gotten really good at recognising and managing them. That said, they are really infrequent so I don't have any particular medicine that has ever been prescribed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw my GP three days ago who said that this new thing was likely vestibular migraine, and gave me something called prochlorperazine maleate 5mg. It worked at stopping the vomiting and nausea temporarily, but I still have dizziness which feels like it has never improved. I can't stand or move for more than a minute or two at a time, if I do I just ended up feeling sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure if relevant but I got my first dose of pfizer vaccine about a week ago also.\n",

      "So I did strict keto for 2 years then, almost 4 years ago, I was visiting Italy, where metformin (the diabetes drug) is sold over-the-counter.  Knowing how strong my blood sugar trigger is, I bought some and brought it home to try it.  Eventually, I fessed up to my doctor and she wrote me an Rx to use off label.  I still eat strict keto every morning - MCT oil for breakfast. a grass-fed buttered decaf coffee a few hours later, and very low carb for lunch.  But after that, I can pretty much eat what I want, as long as I take a low dose of metformin.  I take 250-500 mg, maxing out at 750 a day, so much lower than a diabetic would take, but as long as I take that low dose, I can eat anything, even a dessert, and it won't trigger a migraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know there's a clinical trial looking at metformin use in migraine treatment at the AZ Mayo clinic, so I'm hoping there will be some research to back up my personal finding.  It has been a tremendous addition to my migraine treatment toolkit!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "sooo I've been diagnosed with migraines for over 5 years now. got referred to a specialist around 2017 after the GP ran out of options medication-wise. he put me on 5-10mg Zolmatriptan since it's what my mother takes and it worked for her. thankfully, it also worked with me and still technically does...\n",
      "\n",
      "for over a year now, I've avoided taking the triptan when I can and choose to sleep migraines off instead. before, the only side effects were jaw clenching/grinding (kind of like when you're about to vomit) and nausea. it would shorten the length of my migraine significantly, but almost felt like it condensed all the pain I would've felt into the next hour before easing off. I put up with it, the lesser of two evils.\n",
      "\n",
      "but recently it's been a lot more intense. the pain I was talking about was just the actual head pain, but now when I take it it makes my whole torso, upper arms and thighs feel as though I'm bruised all over. it's suuuper tender to the touch. sitting and laying aren't possible without agony.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also put on 500mg Naproxen at the same time as the triptan and that doesn't even touch its newer side effects. all of this does line up with my CFS/ME worsening but I'm unsure if it's a case of my body becoming more sensitive because of it or whether the medication has a tendency to intensify over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "that probably doesn't make any sense but I felt like I needed to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience of their triptan's side effects differing/worsening over time.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For me, it usually takes the migraine away within 30-60 minutes, if it’s a severe attack I have to take 2. Only side effect I really get is some tiredness if I take 2 pills, or if it’s been a long time since I used one last. I take 100mg Sumatriptan.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take 40mg of Elitriptan. It usually only works for me if I’m able to sleep for about 2 hours right after I take it. It’s worked a few times for me if I take it and go about my day, but my head feels foggy for an hour and a half and then my migraine is fully gone.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I dont regularly take 300mg. I dont take it at all anymore because its pointless. I *have* tried 300mg at once before, and still felt nothing. Botox and nerve blocks both didnt work. Going for a nerve ablation next\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take 10 mg of rizatriptan. Feel a bit groggy at first and my mouth is dry. But pain completely disappears after 45ish minutes and I’m ready to do anything. Tried 50mg of sumatriptan for a while just bc it was all I had available and the pain went away but I had pretty bad mock heart attack symptoms every time.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’m interested that you take 300mg.  My neuro told me never go over 200 in a day. Which is hard when there are repeating migraines over subsequent days. If a pill doesn’t kick it in two hours I take a shot. Those work 9/10 times. Every three months I go for nerve blocks and Botox. Those knock me out for a couple of days but they really do help.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take 2.5 mg Zolmitriptan. . The side effects last pretty much the entire day. My  upper body feels limp. I slur my words 'cause my tongue is just laying there. If I take a sip of liquid, it just leaks out 🤦‍♀️ it's totally worth it, as the migraine goes away within 30 mins.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take 50mg. Usually it takes 30-45 minutes to feel anything. I get a dry mouth and a slightly tipsy feeling. Then the pain diminishes very quickly, usually to nothing or maybe a mild ache over my right eye. Relief tends to last 5-8 hours for me and the whole time I’m fairly relaxed and even a little goofy (telling jokes, talking more), but I’m functional enough to work, drive, etc. Once it wears off, the pain comes back gradually over about an hour. No other side effects.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "50mg suma. The first 30-45min feel like I've just had the worst workout of my life, vomited, and then got in wrestling match that I lost. After that, the weird soreness and pain disappear along with the migraine. If I take it in the late afternoon, the next morning I also generally feel stupid for a few hours, and then back to normal by noon or so. Oddly enough, I'll occasionally take a full 100mg pill, and it doesn't make the symptoms any worse or better, it just gets rid of a bigger migraine easier.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Me: Reading the comments to see how its supposed to be because I can take 300mg without feeling side effects or relief\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Has anyone here stayed on Topamax through pregnancy?  Can you share your experience?  I am on 100 mg/day and I’m well versed in the potential risks of cleft lip/cleft palate.  My neuro suggests to get off, my RE and MFM suggest stay on.  I’m very torn.  I’ve had four prior miscarriages but am transferring a donated embryo - so not my egg and not my husband’s sperm.  I’d appreciate your stories or how you processed this question to come to your decision.

      "Yesterday I’ve experienced my worst migraine ever. I couldn’t function at all. I was hanging out with my friends and I just had to go to my friends sister and ask her for a cold towel. I took Tylenol 1000 mg because that was the only medication she had. After 40 minutes of taking it I vomited twice. It relieved my pain a little bit. My friends had to go to the pharmacy to get me ibuprofen extra strength. It always helps me, but it got into a point where I couldn’t function at all anymore. \n",

      "Naproxen on its own does not ever stop a migraine for me. I would have to OD on it. I combine 500mg Naproxen with 1 Maxalt (abortive) when I know the pain is not going to end on its own. This works for me, but I have high tolerance to meds. I used to take 250mg Vicodin with Maxalt, but of course that no longer flies because so many people could not seem to self regulate, and now I cannot even get it for when I throw my back out. But that's a gripe for another time.\n",

My Dr. and I are still trying to figure out what kind of headaches I'm having. I never thought I was having migraines and for the first year I didn't realize I was having headaches, I thought I was just tired all the time. I've maybe had a couple of what i would consider to be migraines recently, but the rest has pretty much been a regular headache. It's kind of like an annoying dull pain that is just bad enough to be annoying that has been pretty much constant every day for the last month. It's just hard because migraine treatment can get pretty intense and I don't want to start taking meds that I may not need that have wild side effects if I don't need to.

Usually my migraines would be much more intense and I would take 100mg of sumatriptan and get partial to full relief. I'm taking a half dose 2mg of cyproheptadine, and the side effects have been minimal for me (mostly a little grogginess in the morning -- but that's offset by the fact that it really helps me sleep through the night).\n",

I used to have little procognitions before falling asleep nut dream normally. when I started taking it around the age 15, I started to semi-lucid dream every night and I still do.

Recently my tension headaches have been worse and my migraines have become more frequent so I went back to the GP for the hundredth time and this time they suggested 30mg amitriptyline. So I gave it a go and I had SIX days without a headache and I honestly thought maybe it was working. And then.... BAM. Tuesday I was hit with the mother of of all migraines, I'm talking one side of my head feeling like it was being split open, nausea and literally all I could do was knock back the over the counter painkillers and lie down and wait for it to be over. Yesterday I was still recovering and today I woke up fine. And then I got a regular old tension headache this afternoon. I'm just disappointed as I felt like the amitriptyline was helping.

I’m extremely sensitive to air pressure and weather changes and living in eastern Ontario Canada obviously doesn’t help my case. On top of this, I also suffer from tension headaches basically every day.

I’ve done that in the pass but the migraine just comes back after the medication wears off. Am I supposed to take another one once it wears off?

I do often wind up taking an Imitrex every 24 hours for 2-3 days though. That's not a good practice if you are prone to rebound migraines, of course. There are limits on how much you should take, and you should confirm that with your doc. I got the ok from mine to take up to 200mg/24 hrs if I absolutely need to. And I think I remember seeing the same on the long, tiny-print \"prescribing info\" that came in my Imitrex package. See if you can find similar info for your drug if you can't get it out of your doc. You could also ask your pharmacist for that -- it seems like they should have that available.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as for migraines coming back when the meds wear off -- oh yes, this is a thing. It is an unfortunate thing. Many people do take another dose. Take care with that approach because you don't want to take too much too close together, and rebound migraines are a problem for some folks.\n",

      "I'm on topiramate 125mg, and I take sumatriptan when I get a migraine. I was on Amitritypline before which worked well for a long time and I tried to gradually reduce, but they came back really bad and then had to go to an even higher dose but it was no longer effective so they put me on topiramate. I tried propranolol to start with but that didn't work.\n",

Started with some serious brain fog, then tingling face and hands, I still repeat things that have told people before so I'm having trouble remembering parts of conversations. I've lost the motivation to eat but I still feel hungry, nothing sounds good. And then i feel sick because I haven't eaten. I just overall don't feel good. I would say my headache doesn't hurt as bad today but I think i feel objectively worse.\n",

My neurologist said it would take 6 to 8 weeks to take effect, but I started noticing decreased sensory sensitivity like 3 weeks in, and 4 weeks in the migraines slowly became less frequent. Haven't had one in almost 2 weeks now (touch wood) when before it was twice a week.

      "Okay, that’s certainly encouraging! So yes I only raised to 50mg this week so I need to wait a couple more weeks to raise another 25mg then another couple more weeks to raise another 25mg. So I’m looking at another month before I’m at 100mg. I’m really hoping it’ll help. Doctor’s surgery is closed now as it was late when I got their voicemail but they should call me tomorrow.\n",

My neurologist was on vacation when I tried to renew my prescription last week so the pharmacy faxed it to my family dr instead to renew. Something got lost in translation because I showed up at the pharmacy today and the pharmacist pulls out 4 boxes instead of my usual 2 and says \"we couldn't fill the whole prescription, is that OK?\" I replied, \"uhhh... what?\" My family dr called in a 90 day supply of one 50mg tablet a day...so 90 tablets. WHAT. Lol! I didn't even comprehend taking that much imitrex home so I asked the pharmacist to just give me the 4 boxes and cancel the script. I'll get a correct one when my neurologist returns from vacation. LOL! No idea how my insurance was about to cover that.

If he’s told it isn’t migraines but tension headaches or something like I was told, he needs to talk to a psychiatrist as well as get a thorough blood panel done by a doctor who is aware of the migraines/headaches/depression. I recently had a near suicide attempt and was hospitalized in an adult psychiatrist ward and they very quickly realized my thyroid is going out of whack (my general practitioner had apparently noticed a couple years ago but didn’t think it was that bad and so never told me) and I’m now after YEARS of pain and depression and suicidal thoughts I’m FINALLY on the medication I need and I feel so much better already. If he’s having suicidal thoughts you gotta really push for treatment, that is no joke. \n",

I advise caution with the CBD until he’s had proper treatment and really urge pushing for a specialist and not backing down until he gets the help he needs. I live in Canada and I was able to get all the help I needed for the cost of my cheap medication and I really feel for ppl who have to pay to get the care they need in other countries, it seems like such a nightmare to me, but honestly the care I’ve gotten has been life changing and it’s barely been a week.

Can't remember what they are called, but she remembers the doctor told her its from a build up of topamax in the brain, causing these little spots to form. He also said was either taking higher than or equal to the max daily dose for a person. I don't know, there isn't much literature on it, I checked.

Start at 25 mg 2x a day for a week or two and then move up to 50, then 75 (if you need to go that high). Most people find relief between 50mgs twice a day and 100 twice a day. Also, even when you don't feel like eating, munch some crackers or bread. Many people that experience nausea experience it more because their stomach is totally empty.

I had the brain fog, bad taste when drinking carbonated drinks, forgetting words and tingling hands side effects but they were temporary. I’ve also lost over 50 pounds that I needed to lose.

So far I've had tingly fingers and toes, fatigue in the morning (I take it at night), carbonated beverages taste weird, appetite is reduced, and sometimes word finding is harder.

It was kind of startling for someone like me who is generally healthy and never experienced anything like that.

When I would try to sleep I would see flashes of light and awaken anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour later alarmed/anxious/frightened. My eyes HURT, the nausea was awful, the acid I threw up was like straight fire and burned my throat and insides, my heart would start racing when I would try to sleep and I felt very jittery/shaky I couldn’t even hold down water without puking.

I go back to my doctor who refers me to a psychiatrist and start seeing a counselor because there was suspicion of anxiety even though I was adamant that I was going through something physiological and not psychological. I get put on Buspar, xanax, and ambien and just went with it because I had no answers and just accepted it and my mom was confident I had an anxiety problem. The buspar made me feel awful and never did anything, the baby dose of Xanax absolutely floored me and was over sedating (I stopped taking the Xanax a few days later and never looked back), and then the ambien which I continued for awhile to sleep.\n",

Sometimes I would have these spikes constantly throughout the day and it was pure hell. It took a huge toll on my mom who actually has anxiety watching me suffer so much. It’s been very hard on everyone in my family. I start supplementing magnesium since I learned through my own research that vitamin D therapy consumes magnesium and being deficient on vitamin D leads to magnesium being absorbed poorly. I get another blood test done and found that my levels were on the lower end for magnesium and my vitamin D deficiency has been corrected. I responded somewhat positively to magnesium but it didn’t solve all my problems. Exercise worsened my headache and symptoms and I had to completely stop my favorite hobby that I loved so much.\n",

I also wanted to say after a few years of strict keto, I have switched to modified keto with similarly great results but more flexibility.  For me, that means strict keto in the morning (when my blood sugar seems to be the least stable), but in the afternoons, if I eat higher carb foods, or even a dessert, as long as I take 250-500mg of metformin, I don't trigger a migraine.  \n",

Debatable all magnesium is). Gonna try magnesium shortly. B2 seems scary energy vitamins seem scary but I'm desperate as fuck.

I've been losing weight recently and found that they have been fewer - may be related to sugar intake?

I was confused and disoriented. I was trembling when walking. I forgot how to use a mouse and operate a cellphone. I figured out how to call my wife. Who then called 911 for me. She was an hour away at work. I work from home. I had a fever of 103 for no reason. It’s truly a rare migraine and no one understands it and most people think oh you get a headache. No, that’s not it. \n",

I eat within 10 minutes of waking and drinking plenty of water and electrolytes. To prevent nausea I avoid smells and foods that upset my stomach. My wife has taken over driving for now. I always drove us everywhere, she preferred it, cuz traffic is insane here, now the stress triggers a migraine. Sometimes I wear night shades in the car so I don’t see what’s happening.

I had some GI issues initially (this faded over time), felt tired constantly, my resting heart rate dropped to 42 bpm down from 55-ish, and I had insane near-fainting spells especially at night after I’d been lying down. 0/10 don’t recommend. I get 12-20 migraine days a month, tried amitriptyline as well before and also had no luck.\n",

So about a year ago my doctor switched me to Rizatriptan (still a triptan it just works faster and in my case works a lot better) and put me on 60mg extended release propranolol and then pushed it up to the 80mg extended release propranolol once daily and honestly I hated it. I was on it for about 9 months and felt awful. I was lethargic, gained weight, wasn’t sleeping well, was dizzy when I stood up, and my heart rate dipped so low some times it freaked me out. On top of that it wasn’t working to prevent my migraines. When I finally went off it I felt like a cloud had been lifted. \n",
      "My doctor switched me to Topamax just 25mg once a day and that has been a game changer. I have had no side effects on the low dose and it’s still enough to prevent my migraines so much to where I was having them 2-3 times a week and now have only had 3 in the past three months! \n",
      "I know people have had great success with propranolol but it didn’t help me at all and I actually felt worse overall. And on the other side a lot of people have horrible side effects from Topamax but it’s been my life saver. So it will really depend on what works for you, and your body and lifestyle. I wish you luck!!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I do 40mg Propranolol twice a day and have for the last few years.  It has been a life saver.  In the beginning I had a lot of lightheaded episodes, especially if I was sitting or kneeling then stood up.  Since propranolol is a betablocker, if you have blood pressure on the low side of regular or just low in general you may experience the same.  I've adapted to it, however, and just avoid kneeling for long periods of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also switched from Sumatriptan to Rizatriptan and it works a lot better for me.  I don't get as tired from it, I haven't had to raise the dosage since I first started on it, and it just works a lot better for me.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have taken propranolol since 2014-ish. I started off taking 20mg pills twice a day, then moved up to the 80mg slow-release capsule (once a day) about a year later. So far, this is the only medication I have taken that has significantly reduced the number of migraines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it works best for me because my migraines are heavily stress-induced. Propranolol blocks the effects of adrenaline and allows the heart to beat slower, which makes it easier for me to process things faster before I reach that heart-pounding-out-of-my-chest stress response. It has made my anxiety easier to live with, thus making my migraines less common. If I do get them, they're more so tied to things like my menstrual cycle or environmental factors (air pressure, excessive heat, pollution, ect).\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as side effects, these are what I've experienced:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Weight gain** \\- this has taken a toll on my self esteem, but prior to propranolol, I had at least 2 migraines a week that would make me vomit and not eat all day. At one point in my adult life, I was barely 100lbs because the migraines made it so I barely ate. What I did eat would come right back up.\n",
      "* **Heart palpitations** \\- happened fairly often when I first started propranolol, now it rarely happens. Heart races for a few seconds and it's over, but it can be scary, as it happens seemingly out of nowhere.\n",
      "* **Cold hands &amp; feet** \\- my hands and feet are cold, constantly. Nothing helps. I just deal with it.\n",
      "* **Lower libido** \\- this one really sucks. It takes much more effort to get in the mood.\n",
      "* **Sleep issues** \\- I don't have insomnia, but it takes me forever to fall asleep now and I often wake up multiple times a night. This obviously results in me being tired a lot... god bless coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also-- if you are a person who can get pregnant, propranolol is not usually recommended to take during pregnancy. However, since I had such a long history of it and it significantly impacts my health, my OBGYN team gave the ok for me to keep taking it. This *may* have resulted in a lower birth-weight for my daughter (still within normal range, just on the low end), as well as some blood-sugar issues she experienced in the first few days. She's now a completely healthy and wild 18 month old. Just something to consider if pregnancy will be in your future.\n",

      "I was on 120mg for about a year. It had a mild side effect profile for me (occasionally lightheaded standing, cardio was a little hard, but my hands didn't shake the whole time I was on it!). It helped my headache frequency for a few months, but I stayed on for the steady hand benefit.\n",

      "TLDR: Has anyone had luck treating hormonal or menstrual migraine with hormones? I'm looking for success stories, if anyone has any.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am female approaching 40 and although I've had migraine my whole life, as long as I can remember, it became significantly worse in my 30s. I have tried so many treatments with no luck. My doctor has been great to work with and is open to discussing my ideas for treatment. My latest curiosity was whether progesterone could help my symptoms. My body type  and symptoms lean toward estrogen dominance / Progesterone deficiency, possibly peri-menopause. And my migraine episodes are very cyclic, along with my menstrual cycle. I did some research, and thought it would be worth a try. So, at nearly 40 I'm back on the pill. I was prescribed 0.35mg daily norethindrone 2 weeks ago. Side effects have been minimal so far. I have only had one day of pain, that was treated with a triptan, in the last two weeks. I normally have about 10 to 12 days of pain per month.  So, I'm hopeful that maybe this can help in the long run. Has anyone had success with hormonal treatments??\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Desperation drove me to three years of research. I'll paste what I currently do here. It's dropped my migraines 80%. Everyone's different though and what works for one may not work for another. There's some ideas you might try. I've trialled everything on there for about 3 months before deciding if it stays or goes. (Forget the birth control pill stuff!) Sorry for the length:\n",
      "\n",
      "My Current Treatment  Protocol\n",
      "\n",
      "Background/Rationale\n",
      "\n",
      "As we know, a solution to migraine disease will definitely not be one-size-fits-all. For example, there are more than 40 genetic locations with variations that are associated with common forms of migraine, and any one person may have those interactions, and combinations of various comorbidities, drug side-effects, diet, lifestyle, and hormone issues. That's why there's been so little relative progress over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In developing my protocol, I studied similarities across diseases linked to migraine in the expression of their pathology, such as Diabetes, Alzheimer's and Epilepsy, in addition to migraine. What's common across all of them is the inability for the brain to effectively utilise glucose for energy, oxidative stress and inflammatory load. These just express differently in the different diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore any \"cure\" for migraine needs to address insulin resistance, chronic low grade inflammation, and provide an alternative energy source for the body and brain (ketones).\n",
      "\n",
      "Through my years of research to create my protocol, I included supplements of nutrients migraineurs need more of due to homocysteine dysregulation, moved to the most anti-inflammatory whole-foods plant-based diet, regular (6 days a week) exercise (also anti-inflammatory), and an ongoing rigorous fasting program (18/6) to enable the body to generate ketones such as beta-hydroxybutrate for energy. The diet and fasting help with IBS/gastroparesis/functional dyspepsia as well (I suffer gastroparesis).\n",
      "\n",
      "My protocol won't work overnight. Adherents probably need to be on the whole-foods vegan diet at least six months prior, during which time they'll get blood labs done to address low iron, thyroid issues etc. and start on recommended supplements. Only then can they begin with fasting and ramping up regular exercise. I discovered that if one takes apple cider vinegar before and after exercise it prevents the insulin spike from glucose released rapidly from glycogen stored in the  liver and muscles). I used to get exercise-induced migraines and had to stop running for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first few months only, my protocol includes several longer fasts (of three days [72 hours] or more) in order to heal damaged metabolic pathways and central sensitisation through autophagy then stem cell activation. It acts as a factory reset for the body and brain. \n",
      "\n",
      "My protocol works. I'm only N of 1 but case studies can form the foundation for broader clinical studies. There's no money in a diet and lifestyle approach so this is unlikely to happen. Big pharma still rule migraine treatment, and they largely treat symptoms and not the underlying pathologies. Adherents need to stick with my protocol. I only saw results after 4 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, my migraine protocol uses ketogenic principles to target hidden insulin resistance. I have suffered migraines for over 16 years and referenced the scientific literature over several years to develop this protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately 50% of Australians are insulin resistant. Insulin receptors are distributed abundantly throughout the brain.

      "Hi. I started taking nurtec 75mg ODt for migraine when it first became available. At the time the rules were: 1 pill at onset of migraine and then another 48 hours. Then the rules shifted to take the second one 24 hours later. Then the rules shifted to approve nurtec as a preventative migraine med taken once every other day. I’ve been taking one every other day for the past 2 months - sometimes every single day if the headache won’t go away. I take muscle relaxants too when I have a migraine. Finally after several months, my daily headache that would become a migraine if not treated, stopped. I stopped taking nurtec every other day and started feeling better for longer amounts of time. My doctor told me to go back on every other day and now my everyday headache that turns into migraine if not treated has returned.  Could this be a case of medication over-use rebound headaches? I don’t understand the mechanism of nurtec so don’t know if that’s possible. \n",

I take 300mg of Emgality per month when the usual prescribed amount for migraines is 120mg per month. While I do realize that this might not even be an issue, it does definitely seem like my body is adapting much quicker to CGRP interference. Aimovig worked well for almost 2 years but, much to my surprise, Emgality stopped working in about 5 months.

After all, that's how I started taking Emgality. My previous preventative med, Aimovig, just stopped working after a while on it. The problem is that my doctor put me on the considerably higher cluster headache dosage (3 x 100mg syringes) &amp; there does not seem to be any comparable dosing structure for any of the other CGRP antagonist meds. I have no idea why my doctor chose to put me on the higher dosage of Emgality right from the get-go, skipping past the single 120mg auto-injector dose, but I wasn't about to argue once my migraines were under control again. For the record, I don't have a diagnosis of cluster headaches. I think my neurologist was going for maximum effect because of how life-altering my migraine situation was &amp; how resistant my chronic migraine situation was to the many different treatment modalities tried up to that point.

After a day I see skin peeling of my palms, I also had a crackling noise inside my ear (like there's some crackling liquid or a mosquito inside which there wasn't). All of these things have never happened to me before (except cough). I also noticed a different smell coming from my mouth. Not particularly bad but something like fruit odour.\n",

I also kept getting some bumps/rashes on side of my neck till few days after discontinuation (it doesn't seem to be a problem now)\n",

I started to get paranoid that the fog was some sort of permanent brain damage caused by overusing the triptans (which it wasn't). It helped me manage the pain, but it was a pretty terrible time.

I'm also losing weight pretty steadily, which is a huge reason I switched to it in the first place - I was previously taking propranolol, which had caused me to gain a ton of weight that I could not lose no matter what I did. It's now effortlessly just falling off, and once I take care of some other unrelated health issues and can actually put some effort into it I should get myself back to normal fairly quickly.\n",

I'll forgot a word here and there and struggle to remember what I'm trying to say. It's not really too bad though, and I pretty much warned everyone I'm in regular contact with that this particular medication can do this, so it wasn't unexpected. I do also have some of the tingling and pins and needles feelings in my hands and also in my face at times, particularly my lips and like along my jaw, which can be a little unpleasant but it's not really that bad.\n",

My new PCP switched me to the extended release topiramate and increased it to 100mg.  I take it once daily when I wake up.  I went from having 10-15 debilitating migraines a month to only 1-2 around my cycle.  I sometimes get numbness in my right foot and fingertips.  I also noticed I have trouble finding the right words sometimes if that makes sense.  It hasn’t interfered with my job at all.  If fact I interviewed for a better position yesterday and was hired on the spot.  I don’t get the weight loss benefits unfortunately but Im also only 10-15 lbs over my ideal weight.  If it ever stops working or the side effect become unmanageable, my doctor said there is many other options to try like Botox or the newer medications.

      "On 50 mg daily so not too big. But notice the changes! Migraines went from 4-5 times a week to a headache 1-2 times a month. They also went away pretty quickly when I got them as well. I lost ten pounds on topamax and noticed the supresión in diet as well. But I lost the pounds in the very beginning which was two years ago and have maintain the weight since. I have heard some negative experiences as well which made me hesitant. My doctor said that my dosage is too small for their to be any big side effects. I started out with 15mg daily and moved to 50 mg. As stated above I still get headaches frequently just not as frequent or painful. So I’ve been adamant about not increasing the dosage anymore but doctors will try to increase it if your migraines are not 100% cured and there have been some really bad side effects with high dosage of topamax. I think it’s a trial and error drug. But doctors prescribe it like if it doesn’t work it’s a dosage issue when sometimes medicine doesn’t work because everyone situation is different. I think Mayo Clinic said topamax for migraines ranges from 25mg - 100 mg daily so if your taking more and still getting migraines or bad side effects it could be pretty serious and it’s unfortunate that the solution to our healthcare is to provide more medication.\n",

      "hey! I (24F - very active also) used to suffer (and still do but much less often) terrible migraines lasting days and occurring almost every day of the week for years, always worsening with slightest activity. I’m gunna suggest a ton of random stuff that I think contributed to the place I’m at now (1-2 mild/moderate attacks a week) \n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest you look into biofeedback/Neurofeedback as this helped me with mentally dealing with general stress (a trigger for me) and the added stress of having an attack. My university included me in one of their Neurofeedback studies and gave me a “Muse” device to use on my own and I loved it so much I bought my own after I graduated. Studies have shown promising results of long term decrease in frequency and severity. \n",

      "\n",
      "Also you mentioned that you’re trying some abortive and preventative meds. I’m similar to you in that most triptans didn’t work for me and so my pharmacist &amp; headache specialist suggested that I take “cambia” immediately when I feel aura (ideally before onset of pain) and then if it persists to take a triptan asap. (zomig nasal spray in my case was a game changer - tablets did nothing, even zomig tablets weren’t as good) so deffs try EVERY triptan around the sun before you rule them out - and ask your doc about cambia because you can take cambia + triptan at the same time without increased rebound headaches. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was put on topiramate/topamax at the height of my chronic severity and it helped for sure but the side effects were absolutely rancid! So I’m on a aimovig 140mg and it has changed my life with little side effects (didn’t try Botox for other health reasons) if Botox doesn’t work for you- Not sure what your location is but if in Canada ask your doc about the aimovig go program (they will pay for it and do the yucky insurance stuff and cover what your insurance won’t for the rest of ur life) \n",

      "\n",
      "Last thing! I’m not sure if this is common for sufferers but I would always make the mistake of taking as little a dose as possible at the beginning of an attack because too many times I would take all the meds I could and they wouldn’t work and then I would feel hopeless for the 2 days of hell I knew I had in front of me. My doctor said that is absolutely NOT what you should do. If anything take more meds earlier than you feel is necessary - preferably before pain to stop the feedback loop. She described it like a runaway train, once the pain hits the migraine is unstoppable so learn your body’s signals (excessive yawning, depression, pain in neck, eye pain, etc) before head pain and treat IMMEDIATELY. Absolutely life changing. \n",

      "So, I know there have been some questions here about the vaccine and if it has caused migraines and since I got it on Monday, I have had migraines and extreme nausea every day since that no rescue medication or supplement helped. Today, though, I honestly believed I was having a stroke. I forgot to mention that I have had a low grade fever daily. Today, though, things took a turn that I had never had it take. I was feeling dizzy and faint and my BP was fluctuating heavily. I didn't feel anxious since that is what usually causes these things, but I took a .5mg Xanax and chewed a baby aspirin while trying to get in contact with the nurse hotline, doing my best to avoid the ER because they literally had 30 beds (all full) and over 100 patients needing one. People were being transported to other hospitals. Anyways, my tongue and feet started to go numb. My legs started to become unwilling to work and my the pain in my head was something I've never experienced before. I also lost the ability to use my hands for fine motor skills like using my cellphone or putting my.bpbbypins in my hair. I had different types of pain within certain regions while my skull and cervical spine felt like a vice grip was tightened on them. I had to have someone drive me to the ER and by the time I got there, my PNES (non-epilileptic seizures) were about to happen. The nurse thankfully got me in a wheelchair before I went down. Registration was a blur and they kept getting things wrong. The first thing they did was tell me that I was getting blood work done and they'd rushed an order for Ativan. My chart had said anxiety. I told the nurse that I didn't need Ativan and that this wasn't a panic attack. I had to take the Ativan. After blood work, I was put back in the waiting area where they then got me for an EKG. I said this isn't an issue with my heart. Something is wrong with my head. I was slurring my.words and having trouble completing sentences. They insisted on the EKG and guess what? Perfect results. The next thing they did was give me the migraine cocktail (without doing a CT scan even though they told a woman near me that having the worst headache ever gets a CT done). For me, they said they'd only do a CT scan if I didn't get better after the cocktail. Now, I do not know what made the cocktail do this to me but I immediately needed to explode out of both ends while feeling benadryl high. For literally the first hour after they gave me the IV drugs and a drip, I felt uncontrollably nauseous. I felt like the medications were making things worse and I felt more awful. After I finished my IV, I asked for a CT because I still have some pretty prominent pain (thankfully not as bad as before), and they said no so I told them to discharge me. They said that the symptoms I had (fever, body aches, this whatever the fuck migraine episode), all of it was from the vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the exact reason I have been waiting until my medical team told me I was safe. My college said that in order to be on campus, you must be vaccinated. So, I unfortunately went and got vaccinated (then found out my specific class is 1000% online!) And ended up here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for those wondering if the vaccine can cause migraines or episodes, the answer from my personal experience is yes. 1000% yes.\n",

      "Yes, beta blockers helped a lot. Stops the heart rate and blood pressure from going too high, seems to help. But it does mean you can't exert yourself as much - not that you can do that right now anyway because you'll trigger a migraine, but on beta blockers, you'll just feel really unwell if you try push yourself beyond your limit. Where that limit ends up lying depends on the individual and dosage though. When I was on 200 mg metoprolol, exercise was wayyy harder than on 100 mg, without any added benefit for migraine prevention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something to bring up with your neurologist in any case! Even if you might not get migraines frequently enough to meet the usual criteria for preventative treatment, you could argue that avoiding exercise for the rest of your life because of migraines would be terrible for your health.\n",

      "I took 30mg a couple hours ago and now my vision is blurry?? This doesn’t happen for me with migraines. I don’t get auras or blurry vision. So am I having a weird reaction to the triptan?? It’s the first time I’ve tried it. And it’s kind of freaking me out.\n",

      "I’ve been getting headaches with nausea for a little over a year now. They come out of nowhere and are debilitating. Oct 2020, I made an appointment with my doctor and told her all of my symptoms, what meds I’m on (methadone 120mg at the time), and what OTC meds I take for pain (ibuprofen). She had no answers for me, but wrote me a script for beta blockers which I took and they did not help. A month later, it got to the point I had to go to the ER because I was in so much pain, seeing auras and so dizzy, I felt like I was gonna die basically. My vitals were checked, blood was drawn, and I got a CT scan. They found nothing. I had to go home with no answers again. July 2021, I went back to my doctor with the same issue. I was getting daily headaches paired with nausea. Nothing I took helped and I was so tired of crying in bed all day every day due to my head pain and uncomfortableness. The nurse took my temp and told me I had a fever of 101 degrees and they made me leave. Yep. They said I needed a COVID test before the doctor would even see me. I sat in the room and cried my eyes out. I went home and took my own temp, which was normal. I didn’t honestly believe I had a fever just out of nowhere with no other symptoms besides the ones I went there for that I’ve had for months. I bought an acupressure bracelet that helped relieve my symptoms a little bit, but they never fully went away. I’ve tried to find new doctors in my area (Norfolk, VA) that I can make an appointment for, but they’re all either booked for months, not accepting new patients, or no longer accept my insurance (Medicaid). I’ve tried countless pain relievers, heat packs, ice packs, you name it. I also don’t believe the methadone I’m prescribed is causing these symptoms because I’ve been on it for almost 4 years, and I’ve only had the headaches/nausea for about a year and a half but I’m not a doctor so I could be wrong. I’m female, 26, not very active, 5’6, 185lbs. My diet is a lot better than what it was last year as well. Fresh air helps alleviate the symptoms, so I thought maybe I have mold in my apartment since it’s over a hundred years old, but I don’t visibly see any. Car/boat rides create the same symptoms for me. If anyone has advice or any idea as to what could be wrong with me, I’d really appreciate your opinion! Thanks for reading.\n",

Stopped it about a year ago as side effects had  even getting worse. Typical brain fog, hand shakes (not all the time, but enough) etc. And since the side effects kept getting worse every time I had to up it, I'd had enough. And I was never able to shift the last 2 stone gained. \n",

I typically get about 3-5 migraines weekly and that week I only had one. Once I got my medicine again it's almost as if my brain knew I had it and I started feeling a migraine coming. Ever since, whenever I take my medicine, (and not more than the 100 mg prescribed) It tends to go away but then come back ever so slightly. Do you think I am rebounding off the medicine? It's ALWAYS worked for me in the past, but once I took that little break since I was out I feel as though my medicine is actually the cause of them?

Next year, hopefully, I can afford Emgality.  My neurologist says he has massive amounts of patients seeing huge relief from this CGRP protein class of drug, so it is really great news.  Also, as new meds keep coming out, and prices come down, we will all have some choices. It is definitely a new world. I usually have 4-5 a week without it.

      "Hello - I am new to this sub, and I am looking for all the help I can get right now. I recently had surgery under general anesthesia called gynecomastia to correct some years-long issues I'd been having with extra breast tissue (I'm a guy). The surgery went smoothly and I am currently recovering from that surgery now 10 days post-op. Three days after the surgery, I was driving to get my drains removed from my chest and in a flash my sinuses felt like they were swelling up like balloons. This immediately caused vision distortion and a lack of visual clarity. I was scared but ended up getting my drains removed successfully and went back home to lie down.\n",

So, I went to the ER and got blood drawn, CT scan, and finally an MRI. Everything came back totally and 100% clear except for the fact that I have a deviated septum and confirmed inflammation in my sinuses. I was afraid this was a blood clot from the surgery so that was a relief but now I'm still very scared. They give me a migraine cocktail in my IV that seemed to alleviate the symptoms a bit, diagnosed me with Chronic Sinusitis, gave me a prescription for Augmentin antibiotics, and sent me on my way after recommending I see an Ophthalmologist.\n",

I'm 23, male, and other than my migraines, and maybe a bit of weight, I'm pretty healthy. I've had migraines for as long as I can remember, since at least 5th grade I would have one or two a month. When I hit my teens and started going through puberty it felt like my migraines pretty much went away, I stopped getting them monthly, and had a migraine once in a blue moon. I was thankful, I thought it was over, I could deal with 3 or 4 migraines a year. \n",

ER said I had a concussion, but nothing serious and was sent on my way.  I felt better after about a week. I thought it was nothing. Fast forward a few months and my migraines have found their way back. I'm getting a migraine at least once a month, having all the same symptoms from when I was a kid. Blurry vision, blind spots, purplish tie-dye looking lines, ringing in my ears, any smell makes me want to puke, my neck feels like it's about to burst, feeling like I'm in an oven, sweating even though it's only 70 in the house, and more. 'They're back' I thought to myself. The pain when I was a kid was bad, I couldn't do anything aside from curl up in a ball and cry myself to sleep, and now is no different. The migraines didn't go away this time. After a year, I was getting a migraine 2 or 3 times a month. Another year passes and I'm getting 6 or 7 migraines a month, and they're lasting longer. Sumatriptan used to work somewhat, I'd take it, and I'd at least no longer be in debilitating pain, it almost felt like just a normal headache. Now Sumatriptan for me is like the equivalent of Tylenol, no effect, the pain stays. That was at the beginning of this year, now I'm getting migraines what feels like almost daily, having 3 or 4 migraine days out of the week. My Neurologist started me on Amitriptyline but now the migraines somehow feel worse, but she insists on just upping the dose, up to nearly 100mg a day now.\n",

      "I have been suffering for almost 30 years with chronic migraine. I've been trying to get off Topamax for 2 years because I am on such a high dose now (300mg/day) and it's still barely working for me. I've been on it for 3 years and the first year it was great. The last 2 years it's been unsuccessful, and now now it's causing quite a few side effects I don't like but my neuro is convinced it is the best medication for me. I cannot afford the injectables  (Aimovig, botox, etc.) even with my insurance, I cannot take a betablocker like Propranolol because I have a respiratory issue, and I've already been on tons of antidepressants including Effexor (which I know is used to treat migraines) for depression in the past and none of those ever helped my migraines or headaches so I can already rule those out. I feel so STUCK with Topamax but I am still getting 15+ migraines or severe headaches with nausea a month. This is NOT the sign of a medication that is working.   \n",

I think I would know if I was a drug addict. He keeps telling me I need to stop taking these pills and it's not like I don't know this, but my migraines/headaches are so bad that I cannot just let them be with no treatment when what he has me on barely works half the time. What does he expect me to do? Before I was on a preventative, this is what I took and frankly it works better than the Topamax ever did. But I am worried about my liver and I have expressed this to him tons of times. I tell him I want to be on a medication where I do not have to take it as often. I even asked him about medication overuse headaches but he's the one who said he doesn't think I have those. But yet he keeps suggestion I might be addicted to these pills. I am so confused. I really despise going in there telling him I want to stop taking these pills but basically being accused of being a drug addict when I am simply not. I do not take them every day and only when the pain is so severe I cannot function. I also record all of my migraines with Migraine Buddy including every time I take these pills.

I’m so sorry you can’t afford botox/insurance won’t cover it, because I’d argue it’s the best thing out there. Have you tried Cambia (diclofenac powder) as a rescue med— take as soon as you feel it coming on? Or any triptans as a rescue?

My rizatriptan was prescribed on the 4th of August.  Ten tablets in the box.  It's now the 17th of August and I'm down to two tablets left.

They say magnesium is very safe bc the kidneys will rid of any excess but if u do have kidney problems to take caution. I’d phone his doctor immediately and see what amount she would approve.

      "I was put on Topamax for 7 years ago. I started lower and suffered terrible cognitive side-effects. My neuro at the time told me they should lessen if I went up on the dose, which I agreed to try because I was young and naive. They put me up to 200mg daily and it destroyed me. I went from speaking five languages to barely being able to use English (my first language). I left the stove on. I would sit and stare at nothing all day and not even realize time had passed. I could not watch anything with a story because I couldn’t follow it, and whatever I did watch needed subtitles because my brain couldn’t process anything quickly enough. They told me to stay on it because they would subside. They didn’t. I was forced to drop out of university. Eventually they agreed to get me off it and promised that in four months, once it was out of my system, I would have my mind back, but it never happened. For five years I struggled to get doctors to believe that a medication I was on years ago took a part of me away that I was never able to get back, but everyone assured me that it was out of my system, it couldn’t be the topamax. \n",
      "\n",
      "More to what you’re asking about, last year I finally saw a migraine specialist who believed how debilitated I was by this congitive decline since the topamax and she prescribed me memantine (both for the brain fog, and in hopes it would help my vestibular migraine syptoms). It didn’t help my migraine, but oh my gosh… I feel like myself for the time in years. It’s not perfect, but I can read again! I’m getting back my second and third languages! I feel like maybe I could even try to finish a degree eventually, once my pain is controlled some. I’m on 5mg memantine twice daily, which has been enough for me.

I have currently tried NuLeaf CBN, Plant People CBN for sleep, and Gaia Herbs hemp oil, and the last 2 are my favorite.

I know they say you can't get high from CBD oil but I definitely have, so if you are sensitive to trace amounts of THC, be warned :D two droppers full had me feeling pretty stoney.

If he hasn’t exceeded the 200mg Imitrex limit, I’d recommend taking 100mg and some Benadryl.

      "This is most of it, in terms of the nuts and bolts:\n",
      "\n",
      "My Current Treatment  Protocol\n",
      "\n",
      "Background/Rationale\n",
      "\n",
      "As we know, a solution to migraine disease will definitely not be one-size-fits-all. For example, there are more than 40 genetic locations with variations that are associated with common forms of migraine, and any one person may have those interactions, and combinations of various comorbidities, drug side-effects, diet, lifestyle, and hormone issues. That's why there's been so little relative progress over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In developing my protocol, I studied similarities across diseases linked to migraine in the expression of their pathology, such as Diabetes, Alzheimer's and Epilepsy, in addition to migraine. What's common across all of them is the inability for the brain to effectively utilise glucose for energy, oxidative stress and inflammatory load. These just express differently in the different diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore any \"cure\" for migraine needs to address insulin resistance, chronic low grade inflammation, and provide an alternative energy source for the body and brain (ketones).\n",
      "\n",
      "Through my years of research to create my protocol, I included supplements of nutrients migraineurs need more of due to homocysteine dysregulation, moved to the most anti-inflammatory whole-foods plant-based diet, regular (6 days a week) exercise (also anti-inflammatory), and an ongoing rigorous fasting program (18/6) to enable the body to generate ketones such as beta-hydroxybutrate for energy. The diet and fasting help with IBS/gastroparesis/functional dyspepsia as well (I suffer gastroparesis).\n",
      "\n",
      "My protocol won't work overnight. Adherents probably need to be on the whole-foods vegan diet at least six months prior, during which time they'll get blood labs done to address low iron, thyroid issues etc. and start on recommended supplements. Only then can they begin with fasting and ramping up regular exercise. I ascertained that if one takes apple cider vinegar before and after exercise it prevents the insulin spike from glucose released rapidly from glycogen stored in the  liver and muscles). I used to get exercise-induced migraines and had to stop running for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first few months only, my protocol includes several longer fasts (of three days [72 hours] or more) in order to heal damaged metabolic pathways and central sensitisation through autophagy then stem cell activation. It acts as a factory reset for the body and brain. \n",
      "\n",
      "My protocol works. I'm only N of 1 but case studies can form the foundation for broader clinical studies. There's no money in a diet and lifestyle approach so this is unlikely to happen. Big pharma still rule migraine treatment, and they largely treat symptoms and not the underlying pathologies. Adherents need to stick with my protocol. I only saw results after 4 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, my migraine protocol uses ketogenic principles to target hidden insulin resistance. I have suffered migraines for over 16 years and referenced the scientific literature over several years to develop this protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately 50% of Australians are insulin resistant. Insulin receptors are distributed abundantly throughout the brain. Clinical studies using oral glucose tolerance tests to examine insulin sensitivity found migraine patients experience a significant increase of both plasmatic insulin and glucose concentrations in comparison with controls. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note I Increased very low ferritin levels through supplementation in March, which helped greatly and in March 2021 achieved my first migraine free month since May 2019 and after 16 total migraine years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparation\n",
      "Continue other medications until you can possibly wean off them. Current (May 2021) Sandomigran 500mcg MIDDAY.\n",
      "If you are starting supplements, be on them for at least a month prior to beginning the protocol.\n",
      "Check iron levels and supplement until they are in the normal range.\n",
      "Get a full thyroid blood panel. (Migraine is more common in hypothyroidism and treatment with thyroid hormone medication can decrease headache frequency by ~78%)\n",
      "Continue or begin the extended 3-month birth control pill to control hormonal migraines. Seasonique contains 84 pink film-coated tablets, each containing 150ug levonorgestrel and 30ug ethinyloestradiol, and 7 white film-coated tablets, each containing 10ug ethinyloestradiol. Currently I take 1 pink tablet Seasonique in evening, ~7pm. When a breakthrough bleed wants to start, taper down  by ¾, ½, ¼, then the 7 placebo tablets, then taper up by ¼, ½, ¾, 1...to prevent the peaks and troughs of hormones in this time causing placebo week migraines.\n",
      "Obtain a method to measure ketones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fasting\n",
      "Beginning of each month\n",
      "The initial long fast at the start of the month (only the first several months) helps re-set levels of insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic issues, and brain sensitivity. Begin the month with a 3 day (72 hour) fast. After waking, consume 1 black coffee, AM supplements/meds and water followed by 20-30 minutes aerobic exercise. For the rest of the long fast go lighter with exercise and have lots of water, electrolytes (sodium &amp; potassium), and some powdered turmeric in water (speeds up ketosis).\n",
      "Daily fast\n",
      "For the rest of the month move to an 18/6 fasting schedule each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diet\n",
      "Consume whole unrefined plant foods only. This is the least inflammatory diet. Cut out all added sugars and alcohol. Fruit is ok because the fibre is bound to the sugars and won't spike insulin as much as refined sugar or processed carbs. Eat lots of healthy vegetables and salads. Try to pre-cook and cool carbohydrates which increases the resistant starch content, thereby preventing sharp rises in blood sugar and insulin, while also helping feed beneficial gut bacteria.\n",

Mine are triggered by changes in the weather, I can tell when a storm is coming before it even gets close. When my migraine hits I get a bad post nasal drip which causes nausea and vomiting. I treat that with taking 100mg of benadryl every night. Most of the time it works great unless it occurs during the day which usually ends with me trying to subdue it with benadryl and peppermint oil.\n",

I know I’m barely in, but am now on day 6 of my migraine and it hasn’t touched it and has seemed to make it worst. I should be able to just stop since I’m only on day 3, right?

I guess they thought I may have been having a stroke or a hemiplegic migraine as the left side of my face wasn’t doing anything. 4 hours in the ER and I was allowed to leave under my own volition (again me driving).

I was on quarterly Botox and quarterly nerve blocks (the month before Botox) when I added Aimovig in June 2018. I didn't stop my other preventatives. In June 2018, this was before the other injectables (Ajovy, Emgality, Vyepti) were approved and before gepants (Nurtec, Ubrelvy) were approved. Initially 70mg, increased to 140mg four months in. \n",

      "There's some Aimovig data in chronic migraine that shows chronic migraineurs continue to improve on the 140mg dose for 18 months after starting it.

And the improvement has continued to hold through year 3 (where I am now).\n",

I was in 80mg extended release. The thing is after more than 10 years using it, I start having high blood pressure, I go to the cardio and told me to buy the blood pressure monitor and a oximeter to measure my heart rate. I start seen my HR in 48, I ask my doctor and he told me he needed to lower the propranolol because it’s really a beta blocker that blocks adrenaline for lower the heart rate and by that lower the blood pressure. I was at risk of a cardiac arrest. The thing is that I had a bad withdrawal that took me almost a year for completely quit from it, many cardio test because the feeling of heart attack, my heart rate is still not controlled and Im taking Paxil for the panic attacks, because propranolol also is used to prevent anxiety and by stoping it the anxiety is too extreme to cause panic attacks. My heart rate when sleeping is around 48 - 52 and my cardio told me if it go down to the 30’s I will need a pacemaker. Well that’s my short story with beta blockers like propranolol for migraines.

      "Hi fellow migraine troopers. I’ve got a question about prophylactic meds. Briefly, about me: 24M, got diagnosed with vestibular/abdominal migraines about 2 months ago and started on 10mg amitriptyline for prophylaxis. The med has been a godsend. Instead of having 3-4 migraine days per week of being constantly dizzy, nauseous and in pain, I now have maybe a single bad day every 2-3 weeks. I’ve read that as long as amitriptyline is well tolerated and effective (seems to be the case for me) you would further increase the dose to get more relief, which my doc confirmed. I’ve hesitated to increase the dose for a slightly different reason but my primary question is: what’s the end goal? Would increasing my dose potentially get rid of the migraines completely? I have a follow up with my doctor in a week and will ask him but was hoping for some personal stories from those who have suffered with similar issues in the past.\n",

You can always roll it back if the side effects become too much for you to handle.\n",

Weed isn’t regulated, so 10mg from this source may feel like 1mg from that source. Given how different we all are, one person’s dosage could be significantly different than another. Start super small (like SUPER small) to see how you react, and you can always do more once you get your feet under you. I have several friends with migraines who started with edibles, and ended up taking too much and having breakdowns that resulted in ER visits. Edibles are easier to ingest and more controlled dosage, BUT (big but), concentrations can vary from gummy to gummy, and our tendency is to take more if we don’t feel like something is working.

      "Ugh, this sounds like a nightmare!!! I don't think it's strange at all to travel 3-4 hours to see a neurologist. Your situation can't continue! Go! You're talking a one-day trip. One day!

      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, here's what I think is happening:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) low estrogen can cause migraines, and yeah, depo decreases estrogen sharply. So your situation will likely persist until the depo wears off. An estrogen patch (such as is for hormone replacement therapy, but there's also a patch for birth control your doctor may be more willing to prescribe) will likely cause the migraines to end by getting your estrogen high enough to counteract the low estrogen caused by the depo but that's not a normal sort of treatment so it's unlikely your doctor would prescribe it, unless the depo is wearing off soon, in which case they may be willing to give you the patch birth control now. Oral birth control pills may also work but are less desirable than the birth control patch, plus you can remove the patch and stop getting hormones immediately if you need to.  For birth control once the depo wears off you may want to switch to an IUD as it shouldn't interfere with your hormones and if it does you can get it out immediately, unlike with depo. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) the low oxygen environment of the high altitude caused more migraines\n",
      "\n",
      "3) taking meds that affect your migraines every day end up both losing efficacy and also creating bounce back migraines when they wear off, so it becomes a vicious cycle. To get out of that cycle requires something like a [steroid taper](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/medrol-dosepak.html), which is like 6 pills of 4 mg each of prednisone on day 1, 5 pills day 2, 4 pills day 3, 3 pills day 4, 2 pills day 5, 1 pill day 6, and done. They sell it in a pack, which I linked to. If you take that, I bet your migraines would go away completely on day one, it's like a miracle drug, but they might come back in a week or so once it wears off due to the initial catalyst, Depo-Provera, still being in your system for some time. You'd at least get a week's worth of relief, though, and it might reduce the severity of subsequent migraines after it wears off, or you may luck out and the migraines stop when the steroids wear off, and like I said, a hormone patch may be able to counteract the depo's migraine-causing qualities. The real purpose of the taper, though, is to end the bounceback migraine effect you may be having right now, by interrupting the cycle of migraines and anti-migraine meds. Steroids are powerful anti-inflammatories, and migraines involve inflammation, so if you get rid of the inflammation, then the migraine should go away. The problem is that it's not a good idea to take steroids for a long time, and many doctors don't like prescribing them at all, even though 6 days is no big deal. Also, while I was prescribed this at the [Jefferson Headache Center](https://www.jefferson.edu/academics/colleges-schools-institutes/skmc/departments/neurology/programs/headache.html), one of the top headache places in the world, not every place will do it because it's not super well established due to concerns about steroids, even though it works really well. The steroid taper packs I linked to are I think used more for asthma attacks and various autoimmune problems rather than migraines. So the point is, you may need to convince whatever doctor you see, but as long as this is something that is right for your body based on your health history, then I really think it's worth asking about because no one should have to suffer as you are suffering.\n",

For me, going from 4-6 migraine days a week to one migraine a month was totally worth the trade-off of the longer term side effects (some brain fog, weight loss). I eventually was up to 200 mg/day (split over two doses), but part of that was because I was living in an area with bad air pollution which triggered a ton of migraines for me. If not for that, I think I would have been fine at 100 mg/day or less.\n",

I didn't like the side effects at the higher doses so I was bumped down to the lowest dose (25 mg per day) and it seems to still be working.

      "My best recommendation is to increase the dose very slowly and give it a few weeks on each dose to see if it's going to work before increasing, since it can take a while to really work and the chance of side effects get worse the higher you go.

I know this is not what you want to hear however I do have some additional information that might make you feel a little better! (#3 is possibly most comforting) \n",
      "\n",
      "1: I also have epilepsy, so not only do I dislike Topamax for the side effects, but it also has not fully controlled the seizures. I am the type of the person who just can't leave things be. If there's even a small chance that there's something better out there... I HAVE to try it. So I'm switching to other seizure meds to see if they'll work better (also, fingers crossed that my migraine is actually epilepsy related and will back off a little if I get the epilepsy under control). \n",

      "2: I also have ADHD so the cognitive and word finding issues are wayyyyy exacerbated, especially when the ADHD meds wear off later in the day. I recommend if you have any other issues like this, you get those straightened out as well because you may feel it even more. And maybe be tempted to blame the Topamax and want to get off it. This is fine except in the event that it actually helps your migraine....then that would be a terrible decision to have to make :( \n",
      "\n",
      "3: You absolutely must talk to your doctor about this because for the life of me I can't remember where I read this information, and it could be totally different for you, but: I believe Topamax is only effective against migraine at lower dosages, once you get into higher dosages like mine (I like to call it \"epilepsy territory\" lol) then it becomes less effective for migraine and it's mostly just for seizures. Now, I have trouble believing things I only read once or twice and I'm a heardheaded sonofbitch so I have to learn the hard way....and boy did I ever! I totally noticed this in myself. As soon as we raised the dose (had to for the seizures) the migraine relief stopped. And now since I'm getting off Topamax, I'm titrating the dose down week by week... lo and behold, it's helping the migraines again! Really weird phenomenon that I don't fully understand but at least it is helpful and good to know in case I ever want to include Topamax in my medication regimen again. \n",

      "&gt;Impairment of Fertility\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Oral administration of ubrogepant (0, 20, 80, or 160 mg/kg/day) to male and female rats (mated with drug-naïve females and males, respectively) resulted in no adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest dose tested are approximately 30 times that in humans at the MRHD.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was absolutely life changing for me!!!! I was only ever on 30 or 40mg and I had to take it at night or i’d fall asleep during the day (took it in the AM once and almost fell asleep driving). That was really the only side effect, no weight gain. It brought me from 4-5 migraines a week to 1 a month, sometimes less. It did eventually just stop working but I was on it successfully for about 6 years. Wishing you the best of luck!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On 10mg/night for the past ~7-8 months. I got dry mouth, lots of nosebleeds, fatigue, vivid dreams, and dizziness when standing up. Not trying to scare you off from it, most of the side effects lessened or gone away after a while. It took a couple weeks for me to notice any benefit. It took me from multiple headaches a day to having some relatively pain free days but I noticed that for whatever reason, it's kind of losing its effectiveness for me as I've been getting more headaches while still getting some side effects, luck of the draw I guess. Did help a bit with sleep for the first bit. Sucking on some sugar free hard candy or sipping water throughout the day should help with the dry mouth and be careful when standing up for the first little bit if you get dizzy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also have a triptan (eletriptan) as my abortive as some headaches/migraines still get through the amitriptyline. It might be worth looking into other triptans if that's an option as I've heard folks on here mention having better luck with trying other ones other than the one they first got.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I get 9 every month but they’re 100 mg and I can usually manage with 1/2 pill if I catch it early.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if you find it does work for you then ask your doctor if you can also get a prescription for the injectable…they kick in much faster and are good if you wake up with a migraine that’s already past the point where the pills will work.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've taken sumatriptan for years. You might know it better as Imitrex. No side effects but had to use 100 mg with an aleve for the best effect.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I used to use sumatriptan as my main PRN then stopped once all the newer ones came out and settled on Nurtec. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once Nurtec was approved for preventative use, I added it every other day on top of my regular migraine course of care. On an “on day” (meaning a day to use it) taking Nurtec for preventative use, I was given the recommendation to use either OTC meds or sumatriptan depending on my pain level. On an “off day” (meaning a day I haven’t taken the Nurtec), I use Nurtec as a PRN should I need it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully this makes sense and wanted to offer another perspective on how my doctor uses the drug with me! \n",
      "\n",
      "But usually, most people use it alone as a PRN and will take at maximum about 100-200mg daily twice a week or else rebound headaches could occur. Typically nine 100mg tablets are prescribed monthly.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sumatriptan is one of the original triptans I believe. My doctor perscribed me every other triptan first because I think they have less side effects, which either didn't work or worked very rarely. Eventually we tried this, and it's been my go-to for the last 2-3 years I think. I find it works about 95% of the time! The only side effects I notice are some tense muscles, often my neck, shoulders and chest, so sometimes I take a tylenol with it. But totally worth it to me to not spend hours in severe pain and likely useless. I take a 100mg tablet or a 20mg nasal spray if it's urgent (before work or an important event for example). \n",
      "\n",
      "As others have mentioned, important to take it ASAP when you feel the pain coming on. I find mine still works for me if I take it later, but it usually take 2+ hours to work at that point. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this one works as well for you!!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sumatriptan is my lifesaver. Wake up with migraine? No problem, 50 mg sumatriptan and I'm ready to go to work! It doesn't always help and sometimes I need a second dose for it to be effective, but most of the times my migraines just fade away within an hour.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So I began taking riboflavin for my migraine. I went a week and a half with no migraine. The riboflavin gave me a terrible stomach ache. I even tried it with food with no luck. I had to stop yesterday and I’m now getting a migraine. Question for folks who take this supplement are there any tips/tricks to ease the stomach issues? I take 400mg. Should I cut that in half. I go through the company Cove.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "i also take 400 mg but take half w breakfast and half w dinner. not sure if this helps with the stomach issue but maybe worth trying\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not at all, I take 40mg duloxetine,along with 100mg of Topiramate at night. I also take another 25mg of Topiramate in a morning.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm also 30, had migraines since my tweens, with menarche and only worsening throughout puberty.  First success was getting my PCP to prescribe my OCP without placebo, after I noticed my worse triggers were during the placebos (and the corresponding hormonal drop).\n",
      "\n",
      "That helped keep them mostly under control, with less than a dozen a year (at least bad enough to take meds for), until the last few years. Finally saw a neurologist, who started me on Aimovig about 2 years ago.  We went up to the 140mg dose and got the frequency of the big attacks down, though I still have chronic headaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Added Nurtec about a year ago for breakthroughs and it's great. I have triptans too, but cardiac issues mean we prefer to keep them for backup instead of primary. I was skeptical at first if it would work, but wanted to avoid Botox if we could.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also prescribed Cefaly, but my insurance doesn't carry them. I actually just found out about the Headaterm device from here and just found out it's on the way today!  Going to try and get the frequency down further with that, without the risk of the $400 unit first. Combination therapy honestly seems to be the key for many of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "So in short, things can get better, so don't give up hope!  Everybody is different; heck, I require double dosing on most things because I burn through them too quickly.  Off label drugs or genetic testing might be of use too, so ask about those if it's not something you've already covered. Positive thoughts to you, hang in there!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Very mild side effects, but I’m also on a low dose right now (50mg). The most noticeable one is that carbonated beverages taste strange. My appetite is also slightly diminished, but that’s pretty much it. I’ve been taking it for just over a month and I’ve only had two migraines that I can’t explain the source of. I’ve had others, but they were avoidable and 100% caused by me in what I would call stupid circumstances.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi folks,  \n",
      "\n",
      "29, M, feeling seriously rudderless right now and am looking for some affirmation regarding my suspected state as a migraineur. **As per the sub rules, I’m not looking for a diagnosis etc I am simply wondering if you or anyone you know of has experienced migraines in the same way that I am thought to.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve experienced “normal” migraines ever since I was a kid. Typically, I have between 0-3 a year and symptoms include headache, aura, spaced-out vision, numbness, confusion, memory problems, difficulty reading/speaking/listening, nausea and vomiting.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I have spent over a year locked into what neurologists suspect is a sort of “silent migraine”. My current symptoms present similarly (spaced-out vision, difficulty reading, confusion, memory problems) so I do understand why doctors might think I have been experiencing a type of migraine. However, if this is a migraine, it is incredibly atypical for me in both symptoms and duration. This has led me to have my doubts about whether or not it is actually a migraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the doctors that have seen me to date don’t really understand how much this has wrecked my cognition and consequently haven’t treated my case with any real interest or sense of urgency. The fact that I present quite well on the surface is both a source of mercy and frustration. I have a physical disability also and I find that if you don’t look outwardly ill, you’re seldom treated appropriately. Between my physical and neurological condition, my life is pretty shite right now. Thankfully, I am due to see a new neurologist that I trust in September to get a third opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**If any of you have the patience to read my symptom review and timeline, I would be immeasurably grateful. I’d just like some kind of confirmation from people that are in the trenches so to speak. Bonus points if you can give me some treatments to research**. I hear those CGRP inhibitor injections work wonders but I’ve also read they’re unsuitable for people with conditions affecting the blood vessels; I have numerous symptomatic haemangiomas throughout my skeleton destroying the bone. I'll be discussing such things with my new neuro but would like to educate myself beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a quick aside, I can hack browsing reddit and the odd message but for this much text a mate has helped me to put it together. Once they are free again, they’ll sit down with me and help me to fire off replies. Please don’t think me rude if I don’t reply for a couple of days. Writing this has properly fried my brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway...\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;**Symptoms:**  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;The following do not happen just intermittently, a few times a day. They occur constantly throughout every day and are something that I have to always battle.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;**Confusion**:  Mentally it is like part of my brain has been locked away and my capacity for intelligence has been capped at 25% of what it should be. If a task is not incredibly simple, comprised of only 1 or 2 steps, it is like a brick wall comes down in my mind and stops me once I start to think about it and my mind becomes “dead air”. The relevant parts of my brain are incapable of engaging and my wheels stop turning altogether. When faced with a task that is more complicated or in depth than I can handle, even my internal monologue/thoughts shut down. I wrestle with thoughts and how to complete tasks, but it’s more that when made to think about something that isn’t simple, my thinking process completely stops dead in it’s tracks. Sometimes I find myself just staring off into space, without even my internal thoughts going. It gives my brain a break but it’s like nobody is home until I push to snap out of it and re-engage my brain.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;On a few occasions when people have spoken to me, I have been unable to understand what it is that they are saying. They speak at an appropriate volume, but it is like it is a foreign language. I become unable to understand the words they are using. I have experienced this with my typical migraines.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;I also do not feel like I am ever, even for a second, experiencing things in the moment. It is like I am stuck existing in some sort of delay or lag. It is like I am looking *through* my own eyes, watching someone else move, not looking *with* my own eyes. I am constantly thinking about what just occurred in retrospect. Even thinking internally requires deliberate concentration and also increases the feeling of the pressure in my head. Because it isn’t effortless, it doesn’t seem my thoughts run concurrently with my actions.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;**Memory**: I have repeatedly had moments where I have momentarily forgotten the names of friends and family members. I find typing much easier than conversation as I have a running record of what was said that I can constantly refer to. I cannot multitask and can only think about one thing or task at a time. If I try to focus on more than one thing at a time, I will lose track of both and neither will be done. If someone mentions something to me when I am trying to do, say or think something. It will be gone. Also, when I think about something and am about to say it, if I delay by even a second, it’s like someone snatches it out of my mind. So if I am waiting for my turn to say something in a conversation, by the time it is my chance to speak, I have usually forgotten whatever it was that I was going to say. This can happen with whole points I’m about to make or individual words. I am in the habit of constantly writing things down in my phone or a notebook the moment it pops into my head. Or else it will be a few minutes, hours or even days later that I realise “Oh, I was supposed to do/say x.”    \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;**Vision**: Ever look at yourself in a mirror when you're drunk? That's how everything appears to me. Things look alien, as though I am in a dream. I look at my hands and they do not look like my own. I have experienced this sensation with my typical migraines.   \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;I find it impossible for my eyes to focus on a single specific point. I often test this by drawing a single pinpoint dot and trying my hardest to look directly at it, my eyes always end up a few millimetres out.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;In August, my strange vision took on another trait. Once focused, my vision was and is clear and not blurry, however it would take my eyes an unusually long time (10-20 seconds) to adjust when looking from something up close to something that was more than a couple of meters away. This is one of my only symptoms to have improved since August.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;I recently had a thorough eye examination and my eye health appears to be good.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;**Reading**: I loved reading, reading roughly a book each month. I also taught primary age children and it feels like the reading abilities of my year 6 kids would surpass my own right now. As I can’t multitask, I find it hard to both read and understand the text I am looking at at the same time. I could read you something out loud, however I would not remember it or understand it as I was reading it. It is like a reflex. My only option is to go very, very slowly and to break it down. Slowly read a tiny bit, slowly contemplate what it means and then move onto the next bit. My vision makes this extra challenging as I find it hard to physically look at the specific parts of words that I want to. I have found some success with audiobooks but find it hard to focus on what is being said. It requires lots of effort and I have to keep rewinding every minute or so as I forget what was said.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;**Head pressure**: When I would try to concentrate mentally or focus on something visually, I would feel an increasing pressure in my head, it wasn’t painful but more of a very uncomfortable and dull ache, mostly in around the front half of my head. If I have been working my brain hard (for me) then I can find I become mentally fatigued, my symptoms worsen and so does the pressure in my head. I still get this but in the months since August it has lessened by around 75%.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;**Timeline:**  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;In March 2020, I woke up one day and experienced a period of confusion, short-term memory problems, strange vision and difficulty reading and understanding people. This lasted for around 2 weeks.     \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;During this time, I asked my GP and a second GP for a neurological referral and they both said it was probably a migraine and that I should give it a few days to go away. I have had migraines throughout my life and am acquainted with every symptom. I do not get migraines that often. On average I have between 0-3 a year.    \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;After 2 weeks, most of my symptoms got around 75% better however I still had difficulty reading. I asked for a neurological referral multiple times to no avail over the following few months as I still didn’t feel right. Then one day in August I woke up and all of my symptoms had returned, only tenfold and with the addition of the head pressure and my eyes taking a long time to adjust when looking between things at different distances.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;I once again went to my GP in August and was told that I couldn’t have a scan or a referral to a neurologist and that it was probably a migraine. My symptoms were so bad during this time that I then went on to spend a week on a stroke ward via A&amp;E, convinced that something was dangerously wrong with my brain. During my time there, I had bloods taken, an MRI and CT of my head, XRay of my chest and CT of my whole body. They said that they could not see any signs of damage to my brain, only a 5mm sized pineal cyst (these are very common and it’s size is not considered to be within the symptomatic range) and that my bloods were nominal (apart from serum alkaline phosphatase which is sky high due to my haemangiomas messing up my bones etc). During the week I also had a “normal” migraine but none of my other neurological symptoms changed with its arrival.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;Despite my protestations, they said I would be discharged without any further investigations by them as they believed I was in no immediate danger. I did reiterate that I wanted a referral to see a neurologist, which they agreed to make as during my time there I never had the opportunity to speak with one. Annoyingly, I never heard anything back.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;In the coming months, my eyes were more able to adjust quickly when looking between things up close and at a distance but things still look dream-like. The pressure in my head has also reduced by around 75%.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;After waiting some weeks for the appointment that never came, I spoke to my GP again to further pursue a referral. He said I was still probably having a migraine so I paid for a private consultation as I was desperate for a second opinion. I was told by the neurologist/professor that my migraines were thought to be the cause of my symptoms. He recommended propranolol and a course of acupuncture to combat migraines.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;My GP then agreed that if I took a high dose of propranolol for a few months and completed a course of migraine acupuncture (with an NHS practitioner) with no improvement, then he would make me a referral to a neurologist at a hospital that I trust. Desperate to prove whether or not my symptoms were migraine related, I did as he asked. Not because I believed migraines to be responsible at that time, but so that it might push people towards considering my case in a different light if typical migraine treatments don’t change anything.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;I did not have a single migraine during this time, but my neurological condition was unaffected. I contacted my GP after this and he finally agreed to make the referral I’d been after for nearly a year.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;A few weeks later I got a letter from the doctor that I was hoping to see (he is very highly regarded and runs a neurology clinic for “atypical” disorders) and in it he instructed me to try 75mg of nortriptyline for a few months and if I did not improve between then and this September, he would investigate further.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;The nortriptyline hasn’t changed any of my cognitive symptoms but has helped with my depression, nerve pain and surprisingly, my tinnitus. Silver linings etc.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have been on it for awhile at 50mg, and it does not effect my mood.  It does not stop my migraines.   My doctor does not want me to stop it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So… think it over - the injectable. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was scared to death to try the injectable. And then one day I was so nauseated that I knew I wouldn’t hold down a pill, so I grabbed the fat part of my leg and clicked it in.  It hurts like a bitch for about 5 seconds in this one part of your leg and then its done.  You pull it out and its just a bruise after that.  Its not like a syringe - its a pen style so you just click &amp; hold. There is no exposed needle.  And the migraine, nausea, light sensitivity, dizziness - poof!, gone instantly.…\n",
      "\n",
      "You might want to think about this if you avoid taking your meds early until it’s too late. My doc recommended always taking the 100mg imitrex pill about 2 hours after the injection to prevent rebound.  And both are max allowable prescription so that I’m getting hit hard.  This approach has saved me from migraines and rebounds many times.  I despise the side effects but hate migraines more. And if you’re going to have to deal with the side effects it had better damn well work to kill the migraine!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I moved over to Ubrelvy recently and LOVE LOVE LOVE it, but my insurance isn’t covering it.  I have one of those $10 prescription cards that won’t last forever.  It will suck to eventually have to go back to imitrex. I’m refilling my Ubrelvy every month whether I’m out or not to stock up for when that happens.\n",

      "GoodRX has an app too. I have insurance but I always check as sometimes prescriptions are cheaper using the goodrx code. In my area it’s as cheap as $9.49 for 9 100mg pills (which I split into thirds).\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "To shortly preface, I had tried Amitriptyline and Topamax (up to 100mg) and neither worked. I also have no idea how Topamax is a legal drug but that’s a different story. \n",
      "Anyway, after a horrible experience with Topamax I was scared to try any other preventative drug. I am 100% a believer of modern medicine but I just wanted to try other things first. For the past two-three months I’ve been doing these things and they have greatly reduced my migraines. \n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don’t want to scare you but if you search “Topamax” under this subreddit you’ll find many experiences like mine. The worst part was my neurologist never even discussed the side effects with me. I didn’t start to feel different until 100MG. I was put on 25mg and then 50mg by my GP and then my neuro increased to 100mg. \n",
      "I lost a substantial amount of weight. I went from 145lbs to 135lbs in about a month or less. I have a hard time keeping weight on so this wasn’t great for me. Some people don’t mind this side effect. \n",

I haven’t told them it was the medication causing it. I just didn’t want to live anymore, I had no hope, nothing brought me happiness, I was just void of any thought. I remember first feeling off when I went home and I was surrounded by family and my best friends and I felt just dread.

He was the first person to not dismiss my triggers as simply “stress” and he understood the pain. For me I have chronic migraine and it is debilitating. I’ve been taking supplements recommended by my neurologist and follow a strict diet. I take 400mg of magnesium at night and 400 of riboflavin in the morning. I also take a beta blocker. I still get migraines on occasion but the 7 day long ones stopped or at least as of the last year. There was a time when I really felt how on earth is this going to get better so I understand how you feel in that sense. Chronic migraine is horrendous. I wish more people were understanding\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My Current Treatment  Protocol\n",
      "\n",
      "Background/Rationale\n",
      "\n",
      "As we know, a solution to migraine disease will definitely not be one-size-fits-all. For example, there are more than 40 genetic locations with variations that are associated with common forms of migraine, and any one person may have those interactions, and combinations of various comorbidities, drug side-effects, diet, lifestyle, and hormone issues. That's why there's been so little relative progress over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In developing my protocol, I studied similarities across diseases linked to migraine in the expression of their pathology, such as Diabetes, Alzheimer's and Epilepsy, in addition to migraine. What's common across all of them is the inability for the brain to effectively utilise glucose for energy, oxidative stress and inflammatory load. These just express differently in the different diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore any \"cure\" for migraine needs to address insulin resistance, chronic low grade inflammation, and provide an alternative energy source for the body and brain (ketones).\n",
      "\n",
      "Through my years of research to create my protocol, I included supplements of nutrients migraineurs need more of due to homocysteine dysregulation, moved to the most anti-inflammatory whole-foods plant-based diet, regular (6 days a week) exercise (also anti-inflammatory), and an ongoing rigorous fasting program (18/6) to enable the body to generate ketones such as beta-hydroxybutrate for energy. The diet and fasting help with IBS/gastroparesis/functional dyspepsia as well (I suffer gastroparesis).\n",
      "\n",
      "My protocol won't work overnight. Adherents probably need to be on the whole-foods vegan diet at least six months prior, during which time they'll get blood labs done to address low iron, thyroid issues etc. and start on recommended supplements. Only then can they begin with fasting and ramping up regular exercise. I ascertained that if one takes apple cider vinegar before and after exercise it prevents the insulin spike from glucose released rapidly from glycogen stored in the  liver and muscles). I used to get exercise-induced migraines and had to stop running for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first few months only, my protocol includes several longer fasts (of three days [72 hours] or more) in order to heal damaged metabolic pathways and central sensitisation through autophagy then stem cell activation. It acts as a factory reset for the body and brain. \n",
      "\n",
      "My protocol works. I'm only N of 1 but case studies can form the foundation for broader clinical studies. There's no money in a diet and lifestyle approach so this is unlikely to happen. Big pharma still rule migraine treatment, and they largely treat symptoms and not the underlying pathologies. Adherents need to stick with my protocol. I only saw results after 4 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, my migraine protocol uses ketogenic principles to target hidden insulin resistance. I have suffered migraines for over 16 years and referenced the scientific literature over several years to develop this protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately 50% of Australians are insulin resistant. Insulin receptors are distributed abundantly throughout the brain. Clinical studies using oral glucose tolerance tests to examine insulin sensitivity found migraine patients experience a significant increase of both plasmatic insulin and glucose concentrations in comparison with controls. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note I Increased very low ferritin levels through supplementation in March, which helped greatly and in March 2021 achieved my first migraine free month since May 2019 and after 16 total migraine years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparation\n",
      "Continue other medications until you can possibly wean off them. Current (May 2021) Sandomigran 500mcg MIDDAY.\n",
      "If you are starting supplements, be on them for at least a month prior to beginning the protocol.\n",
      "Check iron levels and supplement until they are in the normal range.\n",
      "Get a full thyroid blood panel. (Migraine is more common in hypothyroidism and treatment with thyroid hormone medication can decrease headache frequency by ~78%)\n",
      "Continue or begin the extended 3-month birth control pill to control hormonal migraines. Seasonique contains 84 pink film-coated tablets, each containing 150ug levonorgestrel and 30ug ethinyloestradiol, and 7 white film-coated tablets, each containing 10ug ethinyloestradiol. Currently I take 1 pink tablet Seasonique in evening, ~7pm. When a breakthrough bleed wants to start, taper down  by ¾, ½, ¼, then the 7 placebo tablets, then taper up by ¼, ½, ¾, 1...to prevent the peaks and troughs of hormones in this time causing placebo week migraines.\n",
      "Obtain a method to measure ketones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fasting\n",
      "Beginning of each month\n",
      "The initial long fast at the start of the month (only the first several months) helps re-set levels of insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic issues, and brain sensitivity. Begin the month with a 3 day (72 hour) fast. After waking, consume 1 black coffee, AM supplements/meds and water followed by 20-30 minutes aerobic exercise. For the rest of the long fast go lighter with exercise and have lots of water, electrolytes (sodium &amp; potassium), and some powdered turmeric in water (speeds up ketosis).\n",
      "Daily fast\n",
      "For the rest of the month move to an 18/6 fasting schedule each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diet\n",
      "Consume whole unrefined plant foods only. This is the least inflammatory diet. Cut out all added sugars and alcohol. Fruit is ok because the fibre is bound to the sugars and won't spike insulin as much as refined sugar or processed carbs. Eat lots of healthy vegetables and salads. Try to pre-cook and cool carbohydrates which increases the resistant starch content, thereby preventing sharp rises in blood sugar and insulin, while also helping feed beneficial gut bacteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medication &amp; Hormone fluctuation management\n",
      "Sandomigran 500mcg MIDDAY \n",
      "Currently ¾-1 tablet Seasonique PM, ~7pm. Dose is calibrated/titrated down slowly and up again slowly before and after placebo week to prevent migraine from any sudden transition. Cut the tablets to the correct size. Review dose in light of perimenopause.\n",

I’m tired anyway from my 2y/o waking a lot at night, but otherwise, I’m not really noticing anything else worrying, that other people have mentioned. I will be mindful though if this happens when/if my dose increases. I’m on 75mg per day. Topiramate is the last option on my ‘plan’ but Botox might be something that I discuss with my doctor. I’m unsure of the success rate with this?\n",

Advil only takes away 20% of the pain. I have sumatriptan but I’ve been too scared to try it. I’ve also been on 60 mg of propranolol for 2 months with only slight improvement. I can’t increase it for now due to low blood pressure. \n",

      "Not every med works for every person. Trial and error is common. Plus they can take 1-3 months after tapering up to a therapeutic dose if applicable for full effectiveness (3 months for Topamax). And there are different doses. 100 mg/day of Topamax for migraines is typical, and if tolerated, up to 400 mg/day can be taken, although that much for migraine is rare. Some people even need to combine preventatives in different classes to make a significant dent. Also, preventatives can decrease in effectiveness over time, so patients may need a dose increase and/or med switch.\n",

I was in and out of doctors getting MRIs and wondering if I had MS because the migraines were causing so much numbness and tingling that I was totally freaked out in summer of last year.

Plateaued a bit as struggling with sleep as my dose reduces, and depression/anxiety. Probably not helped by me also reducing my long term antidepressant dose as well (because I have found that it triggers my migraines and I wanted to reduce the risk of migraines as I reduced the amitryptylline). Now I have to try and balance my (already poor) mental health with wanting to get off amitryptylline as it seems to be having an effect on my memory (a risk of long term use). It’s not fun. I wish I didn’t have to be so reliant on brain-altering drugs.\n",

      "I was never totally certain that taking myself off amitriptyline was the reason I went into a period of extreme anxiety for months. It was about 4 or 5 years ago and I was also up to 20mg. I weaned off and did discuss with my doctor but what happened to me sounds very similar to what you experienced. \n",

After a while anxiety turned into clinical depression. A while after that diagnosis, I started antidepressants for the first time. I was very nervous and it took a while...like a lightbulb on a dimmer switch slowly getting brighter. \n",

One of my primary triggers was blood sugar swings and with a low dose of metformin added in, I can can \"cheat\" my keto plan and not trigger a migraine.  I'm only taking up to 750mg/day so way less than diabetics and prediabetics take.  It might be an option for you?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Imatrex and Sumatriptan are the same. I think the confusion here is with the term \"half life.\" So a half life is the amount of time it takes for the amount of something to reduce by HALF. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you take 50mg, after 2 hours, there's 25mg left in your body. Another 2 hours, about 12mg left. About 2 hours, 6mg left. Another 2 hours, 3mg left. So it would take about 10 hours for the amount of sumatriptan in your body to be down to around 1mg.  \n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "When I first started taking 25, my sleep improved so much, that alone helped me feel better and more resilient. I asked to go up to 50 as I didn’t see a big reduction in migraine attacks. But 50 mg taken in the evening knocked me out early or caused my face to flush with any alcohol, also it made me really sluggish in the morning, and I drank more coffee to compensate, not a good plan. \n",

      "What I do now is take 25 at about 5 pm and another 25 at 7 or 8. I sleep well, and have an easier time waking up. And best of all, I feel like I’m getting the benefit of Ami as a preventative because my attacks respond very well to imitrex. \n",

If you suffer from migraines you definitely need to go beyond 150, which approx takes a year with tablets from 100-400mg daily (consult a haematologist). It is infuriating how overlooked storage iron deficiency is but it'll get better! Also your symptoms, like restless leg syndrome etc. might worsen when starting iron.

Getting off it has been brutal tho :( made me really emotionally unstable, which is odd because I don't normally struggle with mental health, so it was very out of character for me.

Just wanted to bring it up because that could be a potential relationship between your depression + migraines as well. Either way, definitely a good idea to explore with your doctor! Personally the only antidepressant I've been on is 20mg amitriptyline which has helped me as a preventative, but as you said the dosage is pretty different from treatment for depression, and I don't think it's frequently prescribed for depression much nowadays anyway.\n",

      "So I've been through a year or so of vague diagnosis and negative tests. First landing on dysautonomia and now migraine. I grew up having migraines and now seem to be having almost constant/persistent migraine with aura but withOUT the intense pain. Depression has also been a problem over the years but especially since my condition got bad in the last year. Neurologist prescribed Topamax. I've only been on it for a week, still at 25mg once a day. I've noticed only an increase in symptoms, including the aura and especially depression. As anyone here experienced this with Topamax and have suggestions for a different direction with medication? I know VERY little about the available migraine medications. I've been on Cymbalta for over a decade and I've heard that this may also be playing a role. Thoughts and experiences? I'm without considerable pain so pain treatment isn't the issue. I feel mildly dizzy, my vision is very compromised (blurry, lines, squinting), it basically feels like the \"fuzziness\" of a migraine and it never stops. Medications that make you feel more \"out of it\" seem super counter-productive.\n",

My plan's heavy hitters are botox, continuous dose birth control, and a modified keto diet (kind of half keto, with the other half supplemented with metformin and exogenous ketones), and then the additional parts are the usual supplements and a bunch of lifestyle stuff to avoid triggers.\n",

      "With this plan, the migraines I do get, I typically treat with 1/2 a 2.5 mg zomig and 800mg ibuprofen and it lasts about 45 minutes and never really ramps up into anything.  Hardly ever any real pain anymore; I'm so happy to have figured out something that works : )\n",

      "Hey guys,\n",
      "Just wanna let you know that I’m finally pain free for over a month now. Since I remember I had severe headaches and migraine 2 -3 times a week. Every week. All I could do was taking my meds and hating myself. I did so much to get relief but nothing helped. I often heard that magnesium can help so I started taking it a couple of years ago. A relatively high dose. About 600-700 mg elemental magnesium per day. However, it did nothing. Then again, about 6 weeks ago, I thought to myself, why not taking a higher dose. Who cares if it’s not healthy anymore. Neither are the meds I take. Long story short I went up to 1500 mg of elemental magnesium per day and ever since I haven’t had a migraine.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For example if you take magnesium glycinate, the elemental magnesium is the amount of magnesium in that compound. It’s basically only the magnesium without the glycine. So if you take 2 grams of magnesium glycinate, the amount of elemental magnesium may be about 4-500 mg. I take magnesium glycinate, citrate and carbonate. Three times a day to get a total amount of about 1500 mg (elemental) magnesium. And yeah you’re right, maybe it is too high and I should consider the possible side effects more seriously. But at the morgen I’m just happy that I don’t suffer chronic pain.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",

I now have under 10 days a month of obvious/high symptoms, but still have chronic sensitivities and have to be mindful of triggers. I can go months without being so impacted I can't do anything but lie there. I still have migraine, a family history of migraine, several doctors certifications of migraine, several er visits in my past for migraine.

      "Migraine is not something you can test for with a blood test. Its a diagnosis of exclusion, a name given to a cluster of symptoms and general patterns. It is a diagnosis, then, that is useful mostly to guide treatment and solutions. The line between 'just headaches' and 'migraines' is neither hard and fast and obvious, nor exceedingly important - what's important is knowing your triggers and what helps and treats your pain, and everyone being understanding and empathetic about it. People want hard and fast lines for things, but you aren't going to get them on something so poorly understood as migraine.\n",

The fact that we live in a society where people don't take seriously when someone is in pain, regardless of if its ''migraine'' or ''just a headache'' sucks, but trying to fix that by saying 'no, real migraine requires the ER ' helps no one, and keeps people who could benefit hugely from tracking their symptoms, finding triggers, and using migraine treatment and prevention tips from doing so because they weren't puking and could still use the computer or whatever the line someone drew was.\n",

Right now, my head hurts, and I have a little vertigo, and my light and smell sensitivities are a bit up. Its hot out, I'm stressed, didn't sleep well for a few nights, and am dealing with an injury that is causing body pain, which radiates for me. I am not going to worry if this counts as a migraine or 'just a headache' because it doesn't change how I'm going to deal with it, and knowing what migraine is and how I experience it can only help in this situation, even if (and this is a big unknown if) the physiological cause of whatever I'm dealing with now is distinct from what happens when its a 'proper migraine' whatever that means.\n",

I take this in the morning, and vary the dosage during the rest of the day based upon my pain (chronic migraneur here; it's not whether i have a headache, but how bad does it hurt and what side effects Loki will choose for the day).  This in addition to a tricyclic, Ajovy(monthly), Botox and a beta-blocker generally keep the pain to a reasonable 3/10.  I also use a couple of migraine specific tens units depending on the type of pain (Cephaly and Nerivio(just started using this so I can't comment on it's efficacy, but @ $100 for 12 doses I figure it's worth a try)).  I also visit a chiropractor about once every 4-5 weeks.  At work i have pink glasses for when I'm not looking at the computer, yellow tinted computer glasses, pink safety glasses, and my prescription glasses are all pink. the bedroom and the bonus room have blackout curtains, and 20% of my freezer has icepacks.\n",

      "Recently I accidentally discovered ginger pills (I use the gravol ones) can help with migraine pain significantly. I took a ginger gravol with intentions of killing some of the nausea and some advil and was waiting for the pain the kick in and hit me hard but it never did. I felt a consistent dull ache but was able to stay awake during my attack which is very rare for me. For my next migraine I did the same and the pain was just reduced by so much. I found a tiny bit of research on ginger helping migraines but the answers are a bit inconclusive. Now I take 1-2 ginger pills, and about 400- 500 mg of ibuprofen to help with my attacks. Ginger doesn’t take all the pain away but it does take most of it and I am so grateful for it. I was wondering if anyone else has tried to take ginger for their migraines or if they have asked their doctor about it? I’m currently unable to see my doctor. Thanks!\n",

I started getting Migraines a few years ago and was able to get myself on Eletriptan pretty quick, which has always taken care of them with a single pill (20mg). I'd usually feel that familiar pain 'behind' the eye and a little nausea, which let me know it was a Migraine coming and not just an average headache.\n",

      "About 8 days ago, I was hit with stronger pain and the nausea escalated day by day. My normal meds and Advil would put a dent in it but never remove it completely. I ended up with two trips to the ER to get IV's put in for stronger medication, which helped on those specific days. I'm on my 8th day now and the pain is back to minimal at least but I'm getting numbness in my right side of the face and still a bit disoriented on and off. Both the ER doctor and my family doctor weren't sure why this migraine hit me so hard with such a minimal or 'light' history of them in the past.\n",

      "\n",
      "So my question for those here with more experience - What can you do to prevent or 'prepare' for the Barometric Pressure trigger?

We then tried the injections. Those didn't work either. For every 10, 9 were faulty and didn't work and I still needed to go to the hospital after two doses/24 hours. \n",

I can no longer get Tylenol 1 with codeine over the counter without a prescription. \n",

I had a slow reduction in migraine frequency as I tapered up through dosages until I was at 200, but it was not very pronounced.

I took 100mg twice a day for years then had to increase to 200 mg twice a day. The low dosage ramp up is simply to let your body and brain adjust to the medication. It could be that you're simply not at a high enough dosage yet. If 50mg per day is your final prescribed dosage and that's only one a day it's probably worth a call to your perscriber.\n",

Now that I finally don't have headaches every day, my career is also going very well but I do want to have children eventually. Stopping with Aimovig (at least 3 months in advance) therefore makes me anxious. What if I go back to having headaches every day, and it might also take some time before I get pregnant - you never know. Are there others who use this or have experience with this?

And yes cymbalta is known to have some pain management side effects, and back when I first switched to it it really seemed to help, I had more energy that first summer than I’d had in years, but my migraines were a lot less frequent back then, more like 2-6 per year vs my 2-15 per month that I deal with now. After a few years of some hard work in therapy and just getting myself in a better place in life I was able to wean off the cymbalta, but had another depressive episode more recently and I’m back on it and while it still helps with my depression I haven’t noticed that it particularly helps with pain this time around, but I also know I haven’t put in as much work in with therapy and other improvements as I did last time yet.

She thinks I have a sinus infection so she put me on antibiotics which have been kicking my ass for the past week. Had to miss my friend's housewarming party and my oldest friends engagement because I was so miserable from them last weekend. Also had to hold off plans with this guy I've been seeing. Had to cancel plans with him again last night because I started getting an aura. My doctor also put me on Zomig nasal spray 2.5 mg which I've never tried before and used for the last time last night. Made me feel super drowsy but worked incredibly well. Woke up this morning feeling good and went ahead and made plans with that guy again. Then I started having stomach issues, running to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. Called my pharmacist and she told me that it was a side effect. Had to cancel on the guy again. We had already had a discussion about me canceling a lot and while he was kind of a jerk (saying he was making backup plans today just in case and knew I was going to cancel when I suggested pushing the time back) but he was being honest. I know I hurt people. It hurts me that I hurt those I care about which no one seems to get. I don't want this. I did not ask for this and would not wish this on anyone. Sometimes I think it would be better to just give up all relationships or trying to have any. I don't know why I'm even posting this. I guess I'm just upset and needed to vent.

I have tried Ami (trying that again, but probably more negative effect on mood and might cause flushing), Nortriptyline, Effexor (I would have liked to continue but it made my face swollen and spread the headache.) Propranolol also but made me feel even less aware at 10 mg and I can't fall asleep. \n",

I do have a history of depression and also take Cymbalta. I'm concerned that the stories I've heard of mental confusion and \"slowing\" are pretty common. Considering these are already issues I'm saddled with, that's a big a worry. This is my first morning, I feel no improvement, but I do feel even more \"out of it\", tired, unfocused. Experiences?

While this means I can get the pain, nausea, and vertigo down to a level where I can drag myself out of bed and sit in a dark room at work hiding from light, sound, and human interaction, driving is sketchy due to the intense vertigo I get. My migraines never go away until I sleep another full night at the end of a hellish day.

I'm worried about side effects as I am already on Zoloft 50mg for anxiety/depression and definitely can't go up on my propranolol due to lightheadedness and not being able to exercise on my current dose due to low heartrate.

      "I take 150mg of Trokendi XR now. It's just extended release Topamax. I switched to Trokendi about 2 years ago. Out of everything that I have tried I would say the Topamax has definitely improved my quality of life when it comes to reducing my migraine days. 25-28 down to 5-8. But, this drug comes with a ton of side effects, it's a black label drug and I'm well aware of the long term risks and side effects. I myself have been and am currently exploring other options when it comes to preventatives. I would seriously reconsider if this drug were prescribed to me for weightloss.\n",

It is a very localised headache: unilateral (above my eye and going \"around it\" towards the middle of my nose bridge) and, most of all, it is ONLY triggered by light. The pain is mild/moderate. There is no moment of the day where it's better or worse. It just happens if I look at anything bright, and it's stronger for a while if I exit a dark room.\n",

She kept saying I wouldn’t like it and I assumed she meant because it’s not that great at migraine prevention. But now I’m reading about side effects online and thinking that’s the problem. What was your experience with this medication?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I used to have a script for Tylenol 3 with 30mg of codeine but when I turned 18 and switched doctors my script was stopped cuz the new doctor said he would never prescribe opioids and didn’t persbribe me anything else for my migraines. Its been years I had to deal with migraines with no meds to help them so I’m getting a new doctor I see him the first time next weed. I want to try fioricet with codeine pills or just fioricet with apap, would it be okay for me to say I said a friend with migraines told me they get fioricet with codeine and it works the best out of anything they have tried and so I would like to try fioricet with codeine? Or should I just say all of that but just for fioricet because fioricet is not controlled and doesn’t have codeine?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi. I’m personally concerned about the butalbital which is a barbiturate that can cause dependence. The 50mg causes muscle relaxation + 325mg Tylenol + 40mg caffeine (cup of coffee is 90mg). Instead of specifically asking for Fioricet maybe explore with your doctor muscle relaxers that aren’t habit forming?  Good luck.\n",

      "I just wanted to let you guys know what’s helped me manage my migraines. i have had them for 10 years or so and go through phases of how often i get. most would be able every other day for a few weeks at a time. I take sumatriptan or 300 mg of aspirin when it comes on.\n",
      "But - preventative stuff is truly what works right \n",
      "... so i started seeing a physio who specialises in Watson’s Technique. it’s all about your spine and neck health. 80% of headaches stem from our necks. So - would this mean most of us would benefit in regular neck massages or watson’s technique ? In my experience - yes! these are the only things that have helped. Keeping my neck health good, muscles relaxed etc. I keep a pretty anti inflammatory diet as I have skin disorder as well, so i don’t eat dairy gluten and nightshades. I keep it clean best I can with fish chicken heaps of veges and bone broth. I take magnesium citrate before bed, b vitamins and a sleep tincture made by a naturopath when i need a good sleep. (i have TMJ so important my sleep is healthy) \n",
      "I’ve seen countless doctors, neuro, blood tests MRI etc and have had nothing but false hope. Changing my life around for the better has been the only thing that’s helped. I meditate everyday even just for 5 mins and always stretch my body. Exercise helps and also, laughing! migraine sufferers are prone to depression due to the exchange of serotonin and migraines. We need to find things enjoyable in life in order to keep balanced. Find a great therapist, walk in the bush, jump in the ocean or have a shower/bath, breathe deep, eat an nourishing meal, spend 10 min before bed stretching your neck and body, get regular remedial massages around your neck and shoulders, or find a watson technique practitioner! and keep it cool. migraines definitely suck, and i’ve learned to surrender more in the past and it is a disabilit,  one we have to work with in order to create a better life for ourselves. good luck, we got this!\n",

      "Some background: I have suffered from really bad l/debilitating daily migraines with aura for years.  They were so bad that I had to take propranolol ER at 160mg to prevent them, which worked but had uncomfortable side effects.  I took it for about 5 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 2 years ago I moved countries and decided to try stopping the propranolol since I didn’t have a doctor after moving.  I also made some significant lifestyle changes, stopped drinking, and started running and lost a bunch of weight.  My migraines didn’t come back (or rather, they are very rare now and come only if I make the mistake of trying to sleep in or am stressed/don’t sleep).  \n",
      "\n",
      "I still get the occasional migraine if I stay in bed too long in the morning or take a nap (which I just can’t do - it always triggers a migraine).  One really strange thing is that if I feel a migraine coming, I do 2-4 sets of 10-15 push-ups, it stops the migraine.  At first I thought it was a fluke but it’s happened so many times now that I am 100% certain that push-ups are the “cure” to my migraines.\n",
      "\n",
      "My theory is that either it is getting my heart rate up and changing my blood pressure (my migraines were always at one point above my right eye - radiating back over my head if they got bad).  Either that or it changes the pressure in my sinuses, as the quick change from prone to standing seems to clear my sinuses (my migraines would almost always come with one nostril getting plugged up).\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffee was another thing that would sometimes stop my migraines from getting bad, but where that was maybe 30% effective, the push-up method has been 100% effective at stopping migraine attacks before they start.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Can anyone relate to this?  I’ve tried googling it but can’t see anyone else talking about it.  I feel like it’s super bizarre.  I have long suspected that my migraines are a result of an undiagnosed heart prolapse which could explain why getting my heart rate up would stop them (I also have suffered from heart palpitations and think that it might be related).  \n",

I’m getting a new doctor soon and when I go visit him in a week I’m going to explain to him about my migraines and how I got Tylenol 3 for it before but I heard fioricet works super good for migraines and everyone tells me that is what helps them best for migraines. Would it be okay for me to ask for it for my migraines? Or would that be seen as drug seeking. I’m not trying to get high i need something for my migraines and from all my reasearch I did that drug seems like the best bet. So should I ask my new doctor if he could prescribe me fioricet or how should I bring fioricet up to him?\n",

      "This isn't perfect. I am considering increasing my topirimate, but it has helped a lot. I'm finally at a point where I can exercise to make myself healthier and I think that will help too! But before, it was so bad I just couldn't. I hope this helps yall some\n",

      "So, I’m not saying that this is going to be as effective as propranolol, but magnesium is a natural beta blocker like propranolol. Start with 100mg per day, and gradually increase to 400-500 per day. (It can upset your stomach to just start taking a whole bunch out of nowhere.) I’ve done propranolol and a bunch of other preventatives, now I’ve found some success with Ajovy injection and [these 5 supplements](https://www.healthline.com/health/migraine/migraine-vitamins#magnesium) that I take on a daily basis. It almost makes me mad that the OTC supplements have had as much of an impact as they have- 10 years now of trying every migraine preventative and abortive under the sun and riboflavin/magnesium is what finally moves the needle for me?? No doctor thought to mention that in 10 years??\n",

In a book by a dutch neurologist I got some info that the daily max dose is 200mg and that it's best to limit the days. I take 25mg as soon as I feel something coming up. Takes generally 1 hour to start working and up the dose gradually with 25mg/hr if not working.\n",

My question right now is what do you eat when you get a migraine? I can barely move let alone cook when I get a migraine so food is hard - I typically will eat instant ramen (not cooked, just crushed up in a bowl),  McDonald’s fries, or some other take out fries that are fairly salty, but since I can’t drive when I get a migraine I have to get it delivered and when I’m getting multiple migraines a week it gets expensive.

I’ve gained back something like 26 lbs over my ideal weight in the last 2 or 3 years, 15 of those during the pandemic. He’s putting me back on to manage my headaches but he wants to put back at my regular high dose. I’m interested in losing weight, and he’s fine with that. The main reason I want to lose weight is because it’s hard to find clothes that fit me right. \n",

If so, did you start with a low dose and then climb up to high again or were you still able to lose weight starting at a heigh dose? I’m meant to start at 125 mg but think it might be more effective for weight loss to do the rounds back up from 25 mg and so on. Or is my body completely used to the med and it won’t work again?

I'm still on a prescription preventative (verapamil), a boatload of supplements every day, and stick pretty strictly to the Heal Your Headache diet.

      "\n",
      "With my good friend Google by my side i've come across 'Status Migraines'. Which best fits my symptoms I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had really intense bouts of nausea. Sound sensitivity which has improved. Light sensitivity which has slightly improved but the pain keeps coming and going. There was a period this morning where I had to go get a covid test. From 10:30am to 12pm there was no pain. But by 2:15pm in considering calling 111 for help. Looking back the stopping and starting has been a pattern over the last few days. I relayed all of this to my doctor but no point of it was made. My triptan meds just are not working anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I' also believe my trigger was reducing the Amatriptyline I was on from 25mg to 10mg and then introducing Pizotifen and then cutting off Ama with about a week in-between. Could this be correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "Has anyone experienced this before?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Amitriptyline works great with me. Been on it for about 3 years now at 25mg and I don’t have any side affects. If I forgot to take a pill I don’t have a migraine or any withdrawals. My doc gave me topamax as a try and see and worst mistake ever. I had the worst tummy issues and I couldn’t sleep at night. Kept waking up at 3am for no reason. I took topamax for 3 days and when I stopped taking the medicine to go back to amitriptyline I had the worst migraine head foggy sleep issues ever for 3 days straight. My chart now says I am allergic to topamax.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "my migraines frequency goes up and down with the seasons but personally I use 400mg of caffeine and 400 of ibuprofen works 90% of the time if I take it as the aura is setting in (literally right as it sets in, 10-15 mins in it just wont work for me). but it makes those 10% even worse since now you can't even try to sleep through part of the migraine. \n",
      "\n",
      " I just had one yesterday so my brain is still fuzzy but the way my neuro explained it is caffeine affects the blood flow in the brain and then ibuprofen is able to reduce the pain. it seems like getting your blood running hard through intense cardio is doing something similar for you! I'll have to try it out next time\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was recently prescribed Rizatriptan as Sumatriptan seems to be giving me rebound headaches. However today I was out and didn’t have the rizatriptan on me so I took 50mg sumatriptan around noon. Migraine is back and worse so without thinking I took 10mg rizatriptan around 8pm. Now I am all worried googling possible drug interactions… has anyone’s doctor mentioned this to them?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I just got off of Topamax after being on it for about 3 months.  I felt the same way as you did.  Worst drug ever!! I was up to 75 mg then decreased 25 mg per week.  I started feeling better immediately after stopping all together.  Good luck!!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I live in Connecticut in the US. Total nightmare of heatwave then 70’s, extreme humidity, thunderstorms and then coolness. Worst migraines I‘be had in 4 years. Just had a virtual appt with my Nuero and went up 40 mgs in my Propanol. Next stop a third preventative. Good times.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "There’s a terpene profile on the label of whatever you buy at a dispensary in Nevada. They are measured in milligrams per gram. Headcheese and Chernobyl have the highest myrcene levels I’ve seen, up to 17 mg/g. Glue on Fire is a current strain that has a good balance of both plus a high THC percentage. A newer one I’ve seen lately with a reasonable price is Kosher Dog.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I live in Canada where it’s legal, and only recently gave it a try. I’ve been getting edibles with indica and I find that even a low amount (10mg) can give me some relief and makes it easier to go about my day. Taking more than that for migraines is hit or miss, sometimes it makes me feel better and other times it doesn’t affect the pain at all, but I’m a lot more chill and kinda meh about the pain anyway. So imo it’s worth a try. Also, munchies are real. Stay hydrated and keep your favourite snack nearby lol\n",

      "\n",
      "That being said, it's an interesting experience personally. My migraines either go away completely or remain present but the high itself makes the pain tolerable. I read up on it a bit- with THC and CBD you still have the pain but you process it differently and it can become tolerable until the high fades.\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally recommend THC if you can handle it and if it doesn't make the migraine worse. It's trial and error with migraines! Start with a low THC dose (or regular CBD as CBD doesn't get you high), or else you could give yourself a headache from too much too fast. Perhaps an edible if possible- just don't eat the whole thing if it's a 100mg dose. Maybe a half or quarter at first.\n",

      "One of my triggers is barometric pressure (sadly, not the only one). Cloudy, stormy days can bring them on, but so can very bright, sunny days. If my migraine for that day is triggered by barometric pressure, it usually starts in the morning. I've been taking 400mg of 5 HTP to try and counter it, and so far, it seems to be working. However, I find that using supplements as a solution only works for so long. Soon enough, the 5 HTP will fail.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don't know if it counts as a rescue but it works for me. It's 1000mg tylenol, 50mg benadryl, and 120mg sudafed (long-release). I take this 15-30min before the storm comes in and no migraine :)\n",

I could cook my own dinner rather than relying on my partner and I could withstand the bathroom light which is the brightest in my home.

      "Last summer I started taking Magnesium Glycinate (2x 200mg) from the brand \"YourSupplement\" on Amazon UK. I used the whole bag (60 day supply) without getting a migraine, so I bought more. Ended up going about 300 days without a migraine, though I cut my dose from 400mg down to 200mg to see if I would get a migraine. \n",

That usually means no sleep for days and just unbearable pain.  The toradol helps my neck relax because after days of a migraine my shoulders are usually up to my ears lol. They give it about 20 minutes to take affect and give me morphine.  I immediately go home and pass out. Lol. I don’t know what strength I get honestly. My guess is 5 to 10 mg…. Definitely tell UC next time to forgo the Benadryl.  Unless they want to try Benadryl with another drug.  That feeling is the absolute worst.\n",

It also improved my sleeping greatly; I do notice some trouble waking up but nothing serious as I still feel more rested and less sleepy during the day than before. As of today the frequency of the migraines didn't change much but the intensity is down to the point of me usually being able to work while having one (also no nausea!) I work in IT so being able to look at screens without the pain worsening was nice. I'm seeing my neuro again in a couple of months to reevaluate again. Before these I was on propranolol which made me feel way tired, especially in warm weather to the point of having very low blood pressure (I naturally have low BP). Every person reacts in a different way, I wish you good luck OP!\n",

I think they just started out quite frequent and they started annoying me. I went to the doctor and they said it must be because of stress (im in gymnasium). I waited a while but they did not go away. I went to a MRI scan after that which was clear. Since then my everyday has been hell with about 25+-headache days a month. The special thing about my headache is that they start  at the same time every day. I wake up  without a headache 90% of the time but by the time i have eaten breakfast the headache has started creeping up on me. Usually the headache last the whole day until i go to sleep.

The key is not giving up and keep looking for a cure. I'm still looking and trying out amitriptyline now. Reading your story it could indeed maybe the stress, but don't rule out other causes. Don't take too many triptans in a month. They might trigger more migraines. Go see a neurologist and ask what more you can do. There are many more treatments out there. You might want to consider cgrp blockers (aimovig). What also helps is limiting your caffeine intake to 200mg/day. For stress &amp; anxiety, taking anti-depressants works best when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy. A good psychologist can help you to manage the stress. Again, everyone is different.

      "Hi!  Sure you may certainly ask :) My nearly-daily migraines improved immediately after starting the medication.  It was a godsend and the main motivator for sticking it out through the tough adjustment period.  The not-so-fun side effects however persisted for a good 3 weeks or so.  My doc originally had me starting at 50 mg per day but due to side effects I ended up starting off at 25 like you, waiting for that to even out a bit, then went up to 50.  I’m also petite so maybe that’s why such a low dose works for me.  I do find that there seems to be sort of a fluctuation day to day in side effects.  Some days I have practically no side effects.  And some days, randomly the tingling will come and go, some fatigue, blurry vision, some mood stuff (though mood stuff is kinda my norm, so…;) then next day I’m back to normal.  Overall I hope to not have to be on it forever but for now, I am really grateful to have found something that provided effective migraine relief and am at a time in my life where I can manage the side-effects alright.  \n",

      "I'm on it and it helps my migraines a lot I get minimal side effects from it but I'm on a low-dose. I take 100 mg a day. I feel a little bit drowsy during the day but only during my day and I usually try to boost that with caffeine now. Before when I was on higher levels of it, when my seizures were more risky I felt a lot more symptoms so it could just be the dosage\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Dosage seems to play a role for me. When I was on a higher dose (200 mg), I was having a lot more \"brain fog\". Trouble focusing, difficulty with words, etc. I'm currently on 100 mg and the side effects are a lot lower. I have a new neurologist, and he is considering switching me to an extended release form to see if that lessens the side effects enough that I can increase the dose comfortably. Keep in touch with your doc and make sure they are aware of your concerns, the treatment can't make your life unlivable.\n",

      "No horror stories from me either!  I am on a low dose though - 50mg.  I did find it hard to adjust to - definitely some side effects (mainly mood related - not so much cognitive) initially.  I was also worried after reading all the horror stories…wasn’t sure I’d be able to stick with it.  But, it was so effective for my migraines that I stuck it out.  Told myself I’d give it a month.  I’m glad I did because after adjusting to it all those side effects have mostly gone away.  I feel pretty normal on it now.  No major cognitive effects.  I have to do a lot of public speaking for my job and I am able to do that just fine.  During the adjustment period I did notice that I would space out a word here and there but it was nothing major and I no longer have that issue.  The main thing I notice is appetite suppression/food aversion and some nausea/butterflies in my stomach type of feeling that is pretty persistent.  Compared to the constant migraines and nausea that came with those though, it’s bearable!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, first, everything has a side effect. Things are relative. Having migraines ever couple days was not healthy for my cognition either (I'm an engineer).

      "Second, topiramate doesn't cause aphasia. It may cause you to drop words in the moment, but it doesn't cause you to forget words. Your prose won't be affected. Your effusiveness and word-play at the bar on a date might be affected, but see the next comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, your body adapts to the drug, as bodies tend to do with all things. Most people who use topiramate say the side effects wear off after time. For me, even the bad taste of carbonated drinks went away after a few months as my nervous system adapted to the new normal.\n",

That lasted a week and occasionally I had trouble recalling some words, and I feel like there was something else, but I went back down to 50mg after about 2 weeks and everything resolved itself. It's possible the side effects would have gone away had I continued, but for me the increase did nothing but bring on new side effects so I just went back down.\n",

I had a bit of a wobble last year, probably due to the stress everyone experienced from the pandemic, then did great during the beginning of this year, got my vaccine and had a horrible 2ish months, which my doctor and I both believe was related to the vaccine. Since then I've been really good! I've gone 33 days without a migraine attack. Just a few headaches and one migraine that I know what caused them.\n",

      "I had my first migraine at 18, but I didn't realize what it was. I thought it was just heat stroke. It was summer and I was working with my high school band and I lost vision in an eye and I felt weird. So I sat down for a bit and got a headache, but felt better later. I assumed I just needed to drink more and didn't think about it.  A few years later a similar thing happened when I was teaching and I had to put my head down.\n",
      "\n",
      "As time progressed the auras (I later realized that's what the vision loss was) would come, but I'd not get a headache. About 3 years ago I even asked an eye doctor if it was normal to feel nausea if I looked into a bright light (I assumed this was a normal reaction).  But I'd still really only get something I'd call a \"migraine\" about every 6 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until about 2 years aho, then they started coming more frequently. Until they were every week. And then they got longer, and the prodrome got worse, and the postdrome got longer.

      "\n",
      "So I finally went to the doctor and we tried a bunch of stuff. My neuro really likes Topamax. A gp had started me off on 50mg a day and he bumped me up to 100. Which helped a bit. We tried aimovig, which didn't help that much. We bumped the topamax to 200mg which just made me suicidal, so we switched to Trokendi, which solved that problem and helped with the number of migraine days that I have. For a while I felt good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried Ajovy, too, but had a reaction to the shot (got really itchy and my lips felt numb, so I'm assuming I'm allergic to soemthing in the shot). It took like 14 days for my to stop being itchy, but while that drug was in my system I actually had a lot fewer migraine days.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried a bunch of triptans, but most of them make me feel like death. Rizatriptan was the one I tolerated the best, but it really only ever took the edge off the headaches. So I asked the neuro if there was anything else, and he gave me samples of the new anti cgrp, and Ubrelvy seems to work about 50% of the time for the head pain and a lot more for the side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when I told my neuro how frequently I still take it, he wanted to up my trokendi dosage. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this, as 200mg seems pretty high as it is, and from what I've read the literature doesn't seem to point to any effectiveness for migraine patients past 100mg anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, I'm scared my current regiment isn't working anymore anyway. I know this is a lousy time of year (I live in Florida and weather is a trigger, and we just has a hurricane go through), but I'm sitting here after having a huge anger blow up because the place I ordered my food from screwed up my order. I normally have a shortish fuse, but when I'm in prodrome I'm irrational. And I feel like it's been happening more lately, and I feel like I'm forced to take Ubrelvy to make it through these periods, otherwise my wife and kid can't understand because I literally am irrational. Stupid shit will set off my anger.\n",

      "**Intro**  \n",
      "After finding a treatment that really works wonders for me, I was encouraged by someone to share this with others. This is thus my first time posting (and even looking) at this subreddit and if even one person gets a positive experience out of this than it has been worth it!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background**  \n",
      "From my early teens onward I have had migraine attacks (I'm now 30+ years old). These attacks start off with a full aura experience for about 45-60 minutes. Then the aura disappears and the headache of hell starts and lasts for about 2-4 hours after which it dies down gradually. Even the next day I'm not the same person cause off lingering effects. My frequency is nowadays about 4 times a year, but I've had periods with about one time per month. Though this is for me already quite a big deal, I realize that I'm probably lucky, as some people have it way worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Treatment**  \n",
      "I used to just use sedatives (a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen) to take the edge of headache and suffer through the rest, accepting that I could do nothing that day but take the pain. Based on some research papers I've found two things that might help. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, caffeine is a very potent drug and synergizes with a lot of other drugs, including paracetamol. It basically gives you free more paracetamol effect, without taking more paracetamol. On top of that, paracetamol already synergizes with ibuprofen as far as I know, thus it might be (pure speculation) that these three drugs synergizes each other to great effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I found that a probable cause for some migraine patients is a disturbance in magnesium signaling and that IV treatment with large doses of magnesium could alleviate much of the headache. Thus I added Magnesium Citrate as something to take. Though it's not IV, as long as you don't take a lot, it's relatively safe, thus can't hurt (I thought). \n",
      "\n",
      "My full treatment is as follows. At the start of the aura, I take:  \n",
      "\\- 400mg of ibuprofen  \n",
      "\\- 500mg of paracetamol  \n",
      "\\- about 50mg of caffeine (through my own coffee preference)  \n",
      "\\- 200mg of Magnesium Citrate\n",
      "\n",
      "**Results**  \n",
      "When the headache started I was lying on the couch, waiting for the buildup to the max level of headache. I found myself completely flabbergasted when I noticed that after a long period of time the old max level of headache wasn't reached, not even close. After lying down for about 1,5 hours I could actually have my evening meal and could do stuff (slowly)! I have never had such an easy migraine attack, though it was not \"fun\", it was 10 times as easy as normal. The next day I was already gymming and could do everything like normal (I did feel like something happened the day before, but it was really faint). One thing that did stick out was that my aura seemed to be more intense than normal (the blind spot was more heavily flickering with colors etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Future**  \n",
      "I have to warn readers that my experience is based on n=1 (thus only one time). However, it surely looks very promising to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I might need to add some sources of the research that got me to this treatment. If I find the time and some people are interested, I would add it to this story. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, I found research that the aura's could actually be due to the opposite cause (the constriction of blood vessels) of the headache (distension of blood vessels). My hunch is that added Magnesium might actually intensify the aura through the magnesium signaling. This might explain the more heavy aura I've experienced. This also means that I want to experiment with adding a second Magnesium Citrate pill of 200mg directly after the aura. Then again, this is pure speculation. I will update this story when I tried this new setup.\n",

      "I wish everyone all the best!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As far as I know the dosage of taking magnesium citrate as a laxative is about 2 grams, thus about 10 times more than my current treatment. Normally, you should be safe as 350mg is the recommended daily dose for an adult male, though I have no idea how IBS might affect this.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It worked fine is probably the best way I can describe it lol. I was on 50 mg twice a day for about 8 months (and I have diagnosed hemiplegic migraine if that helps any lol). It reduced my migraines to a livable amount from me being basically house bound half the month. Still not fantastic but I could actually live my daily life while on it. The adjustment period of about 2 months for me was absolute hell and I didn’t see any improvement until then (I had all the common side effects until then as well). The only side effects after that was occasional numb feet and hands about an hour after taking it for around 45 minutes and soda was flat. I am off of it now and on aimovig and it’s a miracle so if you have the option for a CGRP inhibitor I can’t sing their praises enough.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was started on 25mg for headaches by my pcp and was to titrate up to 100mg. Man this stuff was so horrible to me, I couldn’t even last a few days. Honestly by day 3 at 25mg I was so suicidal; I wanted to drive my car off the road, take the entire bottle and disappear, it was bad. I knew this wasn’t me so I called my doctor crying and he pulled me off of it immediately. It’s now listed as a severe allergy for me.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I started at 50 mg and have worked my way up to 200 mg after 2.5 yrs or so. The side effects were a little rough in the beginning - brain fog, fatigue, etc. but they wore off for me after a few weeks. It’s helped me a lot and reduced the frequency and magnitude of my migraines. I’m able to kill a migraine with excedrin or cambia pretty easily now.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm currently on topomax a low dose this time of 50mg, I find its great but I'm also on 175mg of amitriptyline nightly, every 3 months I get 39 botox injections spread out over my head, neck and shoulders and once a month I have to self inject with ajovy. This is the only combination that has actually given me any sort of a break from chronic cluster migraine Ive had for the last 20 yrs. They started at 11 yrs old. The only side effect from the topomax I've found is weight loss and a change in my taste buds that make anything with sugar in it taste like salt and loss of appetite. So I don't stay on them for long periods at a time because I tend to lose to much weight and then struggle to keep a healthy weight.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I chose not to go on it. I'm pasting the notes I made at the time. I have comprehensive migraine treatments \"dossier\". Anyway, here it is. It might help you decide either way: Topiramate - epilepsy drug - titrate slowly (start at 25 mg per night and increase by 25 mg every two weeks to an initial target of 50-75 mg)  My notes: (25mg of 60 tablets = $25 approx.) Titrate slowly perhaps from 12.5 mg over long period, to reduce side effects, which are many and concerning, weight loss a concern. Topiramate blocks voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels. It also inhibits the excitatory glutamate pathway while enhancing the inhibitory effect of GABA. Moreover, it inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity. 17 prospective, controlled trials of topiramate were included in this analysis. Nine of these studies compared topiramate with placebo and found that it reduced headache frequency by 1.2 attacks per 28 days (mean difference = −1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.59 to −0.80). Patients taking topiramate daily were more likely to report a 50% or more reduction in headache frequency compared with patients taking placebo (relative risk = 2.02; 95% CI, 1.57 to 2.60). Serum calcium concentrations were significantly lower in patients receiving topiramate than in those receiving valproate. Use of topiramate is associated with lower parathyroid hormone and bicarbonate concentrations along with mild hypocalcemia and increased bone turnover, which suggests that topiramate may have long‐term effects on bone. Therefore, taking Calcium Carbonate helps with the side effects of metabolic acidosis caused by Topiramate. Usual adult dose for Hypocalcemia - 1250 mg orally 2 to 3 times a day with meals. I also suffer from functional dyspepsia. Recommended calcium carbonate for dyspepsia dose: 1000 to 3531 mg orally up to 4 times a day as needed. This ties nicely. Topiramate in comparative research slightly more effective than Sodium Valproate.\n",

I was weaned off at one point to go on a new migraine medication and I couldn't not sleep at all. I was like a zombie and weaning off them after been on them so long was painful. The migraines came back in force from having broken light sleeps and they ended up having to put me back on them again. I don't know if you would feel it at that dosage but they can cause sever drowsiness and mess with your mind if you try to keep yourself awake while like that. You speech can slur to the point you sound drunk.\n",

      "I've just come down to 10mg from 30 and I'm coming off it. Short answer, yes this can happen on doses even as low as 10mg. I kinda stuck it out because it was great for nerve pain when it worked, but it was crap for Migraine. My moods have definitely been weird (I was putting it down to the pandemic, but I'm sure this was at play considering how rapidly some changed and how causeless they seemed) always super tired, gained a ton of weight and funnily enough, it seemed to cause its own set of headaches.. However, it's good when it works and for those it works for.. and I'm on meds that raise my hair when I look at the side effects so I'll try anything once. I'm trying beta blockers now instead.\n",

      "I normally never take medications at the same time but it had lined up this way since I take it twice a day spaced out (100mg at morning and night). Part of me feels like taking it at the same time I took my Topamax is to blame for this **so I'm wondering if anyone else has had this happen?** Or am I just crazy and this migraine was just bound to get out of hand? Like I said, I have never had a migraine not react to a migraine abortive before. \n",

I'm planning to do another week and a half before adding another 25mg for 2-2.5 weeks. I only take my Topamax at night, because it typically makes me feel drowsy and disoriented. So I take it about 8:30-9pm and then end up falling asleep by 10pm. The problem that I'm having is that I'm having really restless sleep and waking up several times in the night, and experiencing early awakening (4am or 5am). I am supposed to wake up for work at 6:45am. I don't feel very rested when I wake up and then I feel very low energy and just exhausted later in the day, and feel like I need a nap. I've even had to take naps to be able to get through the weekend sometimes. \n",

Screwed with my sleep in the exact same way you describe plus some other side effects but it worked wonders for my migraines so I stuck with it.  Glad I did - it took a few weeks, but my body has definitely adjusted better now and I no longer experience these sleep issues.  My advice is don’t give up on it yet - give it some time, you may find you adjust to it over time.  Or, maybe see if you can get migraine relief at a lower dose if side effects don’t subside enough.  I ended up tapering down to only 50mg but get the same relief I got at 100 without as many side effects.  That’s just me though…I know 50mg is pretty low so maybe I’m unique in that regard.

(Except if you miss a coffee dose) The only thing that changes is that if you are off caffeine, it then works better to kill a migraine attack.  Generally coffee is both a friend and enemy for me. If I stay below 200mg of caffeine per day then it still works as a friend to get rid of the pain. If I pass the threshold of 200mg then any coffee I skip triggers an extra migraine. Was at 800mg per day where I needed to make sure not to skip any caffeine dose in order to avoid extra migraine days.There are some apps like caffeine tracker that help you to find your threshold and help you to quit or lower caffeine.\n",

I want to start working with a trainer but she wants me on a low sodium diet and I’m nervous to do any diet change on a new rx.

      "In the first week of January of this year, I hit the back of my head on the metal handle of the shower as I was cleaning the bottom of the tub. I hit it hard but I felt nothing, almost numb. In the following days, however, I could tell that I was suffering from a concussion, as I had suffered from 6 previous conscious from the age of 11. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks later, I suffered from an excruciating headache and horrendous eye pain, as though someone was trying to pull my eyeballs out of their sockets while simultaneously hitting me in the head with a shovel. After a couple hours of barely being after to turn over or move in bed, I wasn’t able to lift my arms up, so I was taken to the emergency room. I had a brain CT done, which came back normal. The doctor said it was probably a tension headache and told me to take 1,000mg of Tylenol 3 times per day every day until the headaches stop. I was discharged a sent on my way. I took that dose of Tylenol for about 4 months!! Because I was getting these horrendous headaches every day and the Tylenol made it slightly better (the pain didn’t go away by any means, but it made it a bit less excruciating). \n",
      "\n",
      "My family doctor eventually sent an emergency referral to a neurology center a few cities over because she thought I was suffering from migraines and was worried that the advice I was given by the doctor about the Tylenol dosing was unclear and inappropriate and would eventually lead to a medication overuse headache. She told me to stop the Tylenol right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I saw a neurologist about a month later, she said that I probably had been suffering from medication overuse headaches. Since I had been off Tylenol for a month at that point and was back to experiencing headaches that sometimes brought me to the point of suicidality, she said that I should be put on a preventative medication. We decided on Topiramate together. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I’ve been on Topiramate for just over a month now. I started at 1 week of 25mg at night, then 50mg at night. I stayed at that dose for a little while and reported back to my neurologist that I had been experiencing the common side effect of pins and needles, but in my face, and more specifically, on my nose and around my mouth. She said she’d never heard of that specific area having pins and needles, but it didn’t sound like something to be worried about. \n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned that I was still experiencing aura migraines and had used 3 Almotriptan (12.5mg) PRN’s in the past 2 weeks since starting Topiramate. She said that she wanted to try increasing the Topiramate dosage to get rid of those last few aura migraines. She let me know that the pins and needles could be worse with an increase, which I understood, and I agreed. So I started taking 25mg of Topiramate in the morning, along with the 50mg at night for a week, and now I’m at 50mg in the morning and 50mg and night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven’t had to use an Almotriptan PRN since increasing the dosage, which is great, but the pins and needles have spread. To everywhere. I can’t even name a specific area. Because I changes every day. Yesterday it was my lower back, calves and back of my arms. Today it was my neck and throat and my inner thighs. The pins and needles are always worse during and after  exercise (light walking), and I’m not sure why. And the face pins and needles are always there, but I’ve learned to ignore them. But they suddenly feel worse if I get in my car and take my mask off; the feeling of the mask brushing against my face “activates” the pins and needles. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, my question is - is this normal to get these pins and needles everywhere? I’m willing to endure this side effect possibly forever if it means not going back to those horrid migraines that made me legitimately suicidal. My family, on the other hand, wants me off of this “evil drug” that’s somehow going to take over my system and “leave me paralyzed”.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ouu, yikes. I can’t imagine 200mg. 100mg of pins and needles is pretty bad, but double that, my god. You must’ve been in agony. In a horrible way, I “luckily” already suffer from pretty bad brain fog because of fibromyalgia and previous concussions, so the brain fog from the Topiramate has been unnoticeable for me. I’m glad to hear that you’ve tapered to 100mg and I wish you the best of luck in getting off of it entirely!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Oh yes. When I was on 200mg I had the worst tingling and numbness. It would happen spontaneously, on my hands, feet and face mostly. It was really annoying along with the brilliant side effect of brain fog, to add along with the regular one I get sometimes with migraines. It was awful! I tapered down to 100mg, and I still have some of the side effects but to a lesser extent. My neuro liked it for me but the effects were just too much. If the side effects are coming up, go off it. I’m going off it entirely at some point when the rest of my medications settle\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I couldn't take topimirate.  It made me feel stupid like I was tripping over my words or couldn't get the right word out. My feet and hands would get pins and needles throughout the day.  I never even made it to 100mg a day when my neuro wanted me on 200.   At 75, the side effects were unbearable.   I spoke with my doctor again and she took me off of it and switched me to aimovig which works with minimal side effects and has taken me from 4-5 migraine days a week to 2-3 a month!  \n",

It’s more annoying than painful for me, but everyone is different. I also lost weight (about 10 lbs in 6 weeks), lost hair (ongoing), and was very tired. On 50 mg I never had headaches or migraines but my side effects (plus some that I didn’t list here that I can’t remember - brain fog) were too extreme so my doctor lowered my dose.

I’d tried a similar dose (300-500mg) of acetaminophen alone on a migraine before and it only brought the pain down 30% or so. But I’ve tried DayQuil a few more times since this fluke and it is definitely a fast-acting and thorough pain reliever for my migraine - it brings a 7 or 8 down to a 3 or 4.

This head pain changed my life. And I've spent a lot of time working on my emotions and meditating and trying to heal my mind. But sometimes I stop to think about this and it hurts because I feel so alone in my pain. My dr said if I come off my medication then the pain will come back because it is only masking it.

I can also go up to 750mg per day with nothing.  Once I hit 1000mg, I had some gastric side effects, but the 750 was working so well, I just never tried to go higher.

So my am calories are entirely fat, and then in the pm, I eat more normal low carb with the metformin.

      "- Headspace meditation practice. Allow yourself to offer yourself compassion when you're not well instead of beating yourself up (I should be doing x, I'm missing out on y, I feel terrible, when will this end, this the 3rd day in a row, etc). Quiet thinking and learn to use your breath to ride intense migraine moments out, and find the small windows of less severity (when the migraine is still there but it's less bad than x min ago)\n",

      "I've had awful migraines since 3rd grade (now in my 30s). In Oct 2019 i had a migraine with aura that mimicked a stroke....a first for me, and since then my regular migraines have been worse and i get weird other symptoms randomly/independent from migraines. \n",
      "Also since then, I've become extremely sensitive to psych meds, heart meds, caffeine, and pretty much anything not Tylenol. I got a new neurologist last week (who actually listened to me about symptoms and i cried i was so grateful). She prescribed amitriptyline for migraine prevention. I talked to her about my sensitivity, and she said to start at 5mg instead of the prescribed 10mg. \n",
      "I've been putting off taking it for almost a week, I am so scared to try it. I feel silly but my anxiety is through the ceiling!! I've had bad reactions in the recent past to fluoxitine, venlafaxine, wellbutrin, lamictal, and a few others...all put me in need of emergent care or gave seizures. I haven't taken any kind of meds in the same category as this one. \n",
      "Does anyone have experience with this medication for prevention, or any luck finding something that works if you were med sensitive?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "i also have become extremely sensitive to the side effects of anything. even vitamins i often can’t handle, and i get drunk from one alcoholic drink - it’s a little bizarre because i really didn’t use to be like this. of all the preventative medications i’ve taken, propranolol worked the best for me, but it did have a bad effect on my sex drive. (though a good effect on my mood). i took a very low dose that my neurologist said wouldn’t work, but for me even 20 mg 2x per day worked on the migraines, just see how you handle the side effects. i am currently trying to cut as many food triggers out as possible, because if drugs do this to\n",
      "me, what is food doing to me? but so far haven’t been able to find a cause\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm fairly sensitive to drugs, and trialed 25mg and 50mg of amitriptyline. It didn't work for me due to side effects (I had some odd ones like low blood sugar and hand tremors), but nortriptyline I was able to tolerate for a year. I told my coworkers things to watch for when I first started, since I hadn't taken any serotonin-affecting drugs before that. Maybe you could take the first dose with someone around (unless that makes you more anxious)? I also find that expecting nothing to happen helps me gives new drugs a chance, but it's very challenging if your anxiety is super high. It's is so hard because you know it makes no sense to be so worried, but you're so worried!  \n",
      "I'm on Nurtec as a preventative right now, but I failed 5 before that. It has no side effects for me and it's hanging in there through my toughest triggers so OTC stuff actually works. I'm glad you found a doc who will listen and work with you, that's a big deal!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take 25mg every night and I feel literally nothing from it.  It also doesn't work though.\n",

      "I had a rough go with side effects on zonisamide, many years ago.  I think I gave it a month and a half but the side effects were too much.  For me it was terrible nausea.  I started at 100mg and got up to 300mg a month later but it was not compatible with work and my life to feel so sick.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For me, it was in the middle of having tried a beta blocker, a calcium channel blocker, another anti-seizure, and then a different beta blocker.  None of these produced adequate suppression and all had side effects for me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It took years but I did ultimately find a treatment plan that works.  Mine is complex but the gist is modified keto diet plus exogenous ketones, botox every 5 months, complete suppression of my cycle with continuous dose birth control, the usual supplements, and a bunch of lifestyle stuff to avoid triggers.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi all,\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed a lot of info/experiences on this sub about topamax. I was prescribed topamax not for migraines but for some nerve issues I was experiencing. Hope it’s ok to post a question about it here even though it’s not migraine related.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in 50mg twice a day for only 3 weeks (25mg twice a day for first week). It did actually seem to help my nerve issue but made me incredibly incredibly itchy. Then I started to get hives as well. A short time after the itchiness, I’d wake up with incredibly sore leg muscles. First just my calfs. Then my whole legs - with no change in any strenuous activity. I asked my neurologist to stop the topamax thinking perhaps I could be allergic to it. She said go ahead and stop cold turkey since I was in a small dose. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been 5 days since stopping. My nerve issue has expectantly gotten worse again, but what’s odd is the itchiness/hives/muscles soreness have not subsided at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Has anyone had similar side effects? And from browsing this subreddit, it seems like side effects of topamax can linger after stopping, but is that typical even after only three weeks? I started citalopram just a few weeks before the topamax. My only other thinking is that these are side effects of the citalopram even though I experienced none until I started the topamax.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Do they go away by the time you wake up? Does the ice pack make them go away?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mine generally just keep getting worse as the hours pass. Usually I can make it thru 8 hours of sleep, wake up and pop a 50 mg caffeine pill and that knocks it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately they've been way too strong to get knocked out by 50 mg of caffeine, and often too strong for any amount of caffeine to knock them out\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Tbh im still finding my best treatment. Because I have so many triggers, but my main thing that helps relieve me from have as many migraine is Stress. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finding things that help me be less stress or relax me. (Problem is I love video games so I can't do that as much as I wanna because of my head)\n",

      "Heating pads and cool packs are my friends as well lol \n",
      "Edit: I do take medication of course I have 2 prevents one oral the other is a shot, &amp; 600 mg ibuprofen also I take \"another thing\" as well but don't know if im aloud to say here, but that helps the most, in relaxing me.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes! It was prescribed as a preventative. I take 600mg 3x a day, so 1800mg in total each day. It also helps with anxiety, but my prescription is for preventing migraine onset.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want to be on it forever, but for the time being it’s helping.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Is salt a trigger for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmmm ... Seems like I misread the label before and didn't realize it was 350 mg of sodium per serving. So, Two boxes of these a day would mean 2800 mg of sodium.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't realize it was that much. On top of that I use about 3000 - 4000 mg of salt.\n",

      "Maybe that's the issue.\n",

      "Since starting 25mg of Elavil nightly, I haven’t had a single migraine that lasts over 24 hours (most have been under 12 hours). I’ve also seen a reduction in intensity of pain. I just increased to 50mg and am hoping for even more of a reduction in frequency, intensity, and length. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first preventative I have tried after suffering from migraines since childhood and I’m very pleased that I finally took the plunge and decided to try medication.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It is constant no matter what. The last few months I was prescribed propranolol and it hs helped immensely with the number each month and hs also helped my abortives work more quickly and better. Before I would have to take 2 50mg imitrex to cut it and now I can take 1 and it’s gone. My neurologist also suggested taking my imitrex with Aleve (naproxen sodium) to help it work better. That combo has been great.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah I actually feel my brain chemicals dip before I get a migraine and I feel lethargic and really depressed. I'm on 40mg of prozac now which definitely takes the edge of it, bit I can still feel the \"dip\".\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I started out with 10mg and then went off to 25mg. \n",
      "It wasn't working for me so my doctor decided it was better to stop. She told me to take half a pill of the 25mg pill everyday for a month, and then stop (I assumed I was supposed to because she did not answer my text about eventually tapering off slower with other dosages).\n",
      "\n",
      "I have now completed the tapering off and these last couple of weeks have been absolutely horrible. I'm having a migraine attack every day now. I have also run out of meds. On top of that I'm approaching exam week and I can't study whatsoever. I'm miserable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've also developed trichotillomania when I started tapering off and I'm sad about that too.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who tapered off amitriptyline, was it slower? Did anyone else develop trichotillomania with this drug? Any advice? Thank you.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I would probably be wary as well. I started at only 10mg and I was getting some pretty nasty side effects for a few months albeit not panic attacks.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I would be wary! I jumped right in with 25mg and had a terrible experience with panic attacks the next day. I would advise starting slowly.\n",

      "\n",
      "The history\n",
      "\n",
      "I have suffered from migraines with aura since I was about 13, I’m now 37. I only get about 4 or 5 year but even that is too many for me. Although I get ocular migraines every few days like when I blink I see a pattern like a camera flash gone off in one eye, but that usually goes in about 10 minutes and doesn’t lead to anything else. I had an extremely bad migraine in 2009 and I took Zolmitriptan which made the aura last about 4 hours longer than the normal 1 hour, couldn’t string a sentence together and I was very sick too. That lead me to go and see my doctor because I just could not go through that again.\n",
      "He prescribed me 10mg of Amitriptyline to take daily so I gave that a go and for the first 2 and a half years I was migraine free it was amazing, then they started to occur again. The severity wasn’t as bad, but it was still bad enough, so I increased to 20mg, this pattern continued so now I take 40mg of Amitriptyline daily which makes me feel like a tired zombie most of the time. I’d really like to cut down on it but I know it’s incredibly hard to come off of but would like to try at some point when I feel ready too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Being an anxious person anyway I have always been terrified of when the next migraine will happen, I mean there’s not a day goes by where I don’t think about it happening. I am constantly checking if one has started and always looking at my arms and hands to see if part of them is missing from my vision and the aura is starting.\n",
      "I panic about getting stuck at work and cannot drive home or one happens when I driving on a long journey. My head is full of what if’s like I have to pick the children up from school at a certain time and what if I get a migraine and can’t get them what would I do as I only have limited people to rely on which have other things to do and can’t be there for me incase that happens all the time. I have never found what triggers them, regardless of trying different things to find out nothing has ever been conclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Migraine has literally controlled my life for the past 24 years or so. It is factored into every decision I make and non-suffers just don’t understand what it’s like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any tips in coping with the fear, I’ve really had enough of it and I’m a man btw if that makes any difference…\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have found taking Sumatriptan earlier lessens side effects. Also the lowest dose that works…I cut a 100mg in half and take 2 hours apart with an Advil. Also, I don’t sleep if I can help it, because a nap makes side effects worse for me. I usually take first dose after dinner once I have figured out the dang thing is a migraine. Get the heavy feeling, tight neck, burning feeling in sinuses, and sensitive to hot water. But again, If I don’t wait a couple days too long, it is way milder.\n",

      "Weird that your insurance won’t let you have enough Zofran! I HAVE to take a zofran with Rizatriptan. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, if you have waited a while before deciding to take the triptan, taking an NSAID along with it can help (my Neuro RX’d 500mg Naproxen for this purpose).\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Actually there is a warning on my Zomig label now, that I cannot drive within the first 4 hours after taking a Zomig tablet 2.5 mg. And if I do and cause an accident my insurance is not valid.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Since we only get 9 pills a month, I get 100mg and break them. Probably not supposed to tell people to do this, but I had my own doctor suggest this to me. It's worked out for me for many years!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I've tried quite a few trips and they're all slightly different.  I've settled on Eletriptan (Relpax) as giving me the best results with the least backfires.  I buy the 80mg and usually cut them in half, but have the option for the whole hog.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",

I have a strong genetic link though my uncle has cluster headaches and chronic migraines like me, my mum had them until she was about 40 and they stopped, my 22 year old brother started getting them last year and now my nephew who is 14 had his first Migraine last month that lasted 3 days :(\n",

If it makes me worse though I will happily go for an alternative so will see how I get on with it.. I think I need to try more alternative meds I’ve heard B2 and coq10 help I take magnesium already.. Maybe try a different med if my nuro too am on pregnlone and topiramate but only 50mg topiramate right now so May ask to increase that dose..

      "hey, CBD has been a really good (for me personally). i use it as an abortive medicine at onset of migraine(during my pre-migraine headaches) as an alternative to sumatriptan that my doctor prescribed. so it stops a full attack before it happens. also probably ends a full-on migraine attack i’m guessing. for me, my pre-migraine headache pain (like a 7/10 pain for example) goes away within 30m after taking a gummy (about 10-15mg CBD). i caution that i am not giving professional medical advice here, just what has been my experience of trial and error! not sure what a med card is though\n",

      "Hello, so sorry you’re going through this. I feel the same. Have had migraines all of my life, no treatment has worked, and they did find a migraine spot on my brain but all I can do is try to prevent them now via meds. It’s all very discouraging. No idea what causes mine or what kind they are, but you’re definitely not alone. I also feel intense pain behind my eyes. I’m on 300mg of gabapentin too, and I take 6 everyday to no avail. :( I hope relief comes for us soon.\n",

      "On mobile so the formatting be off but I actually suffer from chronic migraines, cluster head aches and tension headaches. Everyone's migraines are different but I can say that my cluster head aches actually start with pressure behind my left eye, my eye actually bulges slightly during it and feels like there's severe pressure about to burst through my forehead. Based off your description however they may be tension headaches, I actually started getting tension headaches after trying sumatripran, I will get a knot of muscles in my neck and my entire right side would will tighten up completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that being said everyone is different and what works for some may not work for others, personally I overloading my brain helpful with my migraines, for example using extremely hot, hot sauce or eating something with a ton of horseradish or wasabi. My brain almost loses track of the pain and it turns into a soft reset. Doesn't work all the time but it helps.\n",

      "Obligatory not asking for medical advice, just wondering if I need to find a new neurologist or get a second opinion. Short version - I've had chronic migraines for the last 2.5 years. I always have a headache and usually have some degree of 'migraine' signs. We've tried topamax - worked decently but came with some annoying side effects, gabapentin - helped but neuro won't prescribe it anymore, seems to think it doesn't do anything but make you feel good about life, and aimovig. The aimovig definitely helps but I have allergic reactions to it and I still feel like I have more migraine days than not, even on the 140 mg. Neuro seems resistant to try anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what concerns me though - never in the last 2 years has he given me any kind of abortive medication. I have nothing to take on a bad day or really any guidance whatsoever of what else I can do. I do take magnesium and have taken b2 and coq10 before (as recommended by my obgyn).\n",

      "I take 100 mg topiramate a day. I can't stop taking it because my migraines come back terrible. I stay at about 1 a month. It does cause all that is mentioned. You just have to weigh the pros and cons. I have alot better life than I used to. A migraine every week.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have quit topiramate last sunday because it made me feel a little low and I wasn't able to think clearly, even on a lower dosage. The sad thing is, it did work wonders for my migraine. When I took 50 mgs, I had no headaches. However, because I was so confused, my neurologist first put me on a lower dosage (25mgs). My migraines slightly improved, but is was not worth it to have more energy and feel very 'meh' about life for no particular reason. And I still had about two attacks a week on average. The neurologist at first told me I had to choose between feeling depressed and having fewer migraines, but when I told him the number of migraines I had still been having, I finally got referred to a neurologist that specializes in headaches that I will see at the 15th of july so we can talk about 'Erenumab' injections. Looking forward to that. It is a last resort. I am hopeful that I will find something that will work.  \n",

      "I looked up how long topiramate stays in your body, it seems to take 4 to 6 days to completely disappear. On a website I also found that 'anxiety' and 'depression' are common side effects. It seems that despite no research has ever proven withdrawal can take longer than those 6 days, many people seem to be reporting withdrawal symptoms for a couple of weeks. This sucks! It feels so chemically determined as well, there are many things I want to do, but it is all overridden by this extreme lack of motivation. I feel tired as well, I want to lay down.

      "Hi everyone! A while ago I posted that I would be going to the hospital for 2-5 days for DHE infusions in order to help break my current migraine cycle. Sorry for the long wait but here is my update on that. ~PLEASE keep in mind that any and all experiences I had are unique to myself and the side effects and results of this treatment vary depending on the person, this is just what I went through.~\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent a total of 3 days in the hospital (2 nights). I arrived Saturday morning and left Monday evening. The actual treatment was fairly brutal. I discovered my veins are quite sensitive and while my nurses were amazing and found the vein for my IV on the first try, we ended up needing to put in a different IV on my other arm on the third day because of the pain I experienced. Most people don’t have IV pain like that, and the doctors and nurses kept a very close eye on it just to make sure it didn’t become a problem (the IV itself ended up being fine but my veins and arm were just sensitive and irritated). They started the actual protocol with a dosage of Zofran that ran via IV for 30 minutes before the dhe to help with the nausea (they later gave me Zofran in dissolvable tablets bc the IV version made me so dizzy and I definitely preferred the tablets). I then started off with (I believe) either .25 mg or .50 mg of the dhe via IV for one hour. And that ish was not fun. The Zofran didn’t help at all and so they gave me Benadryl through my IV for the next infusion which took place 8 hours later. (I did not sleep a lot because the treatments went late). This time the dosage increased +.25 mg and they let me do it over the course of 2 hours because I was so nauseous. By the time I reached the maximum dosage of 1mg I had to have to the infusion over the course of 2.5 hours just to avoid throwing up. And even then I was miserable and would usually be given Benadryl to help the nausea and put me to sleep. After 3 days of constant nausea, throwing up twice, only being able to stomach food twice, and crying in front of my parents more than I’d like to admit...it worked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kind of. \n",
      "\n",
      "While in the hospital I was surprisingly headache free, and as great as that sounds, I was far too miserable to care because of pain from my IV site (heat packs were my saving grace btw) and barely being able to eat. But since I was headache free I was able to be discharged. HOORAY! Except one problem. 24 hours after I came home- my migraines did too. So now I’m back to square one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry it took so long for the update, I was honestly just taking time to process as the whole ordeal was rather traumatizing for me and I’ve had several nightmares involving hospitals since then. I’m not saying that all DHE experiences are like this. In fact my friend gets it done every 3 months and it works *wonders* for them and they have very few issues with the side effects other than some nausea. I think it was partially because I was thrust into it all so quickly and then taken out of it just as fast that my brain wasn’t really sure what was happening lol. My nurses were absolutely incredible though and really did their best to make me feel better in any way they could, so shout out to them. My neuro and I talked today and (ironically) she prescribed the dhe nasal spray for me to use as a rescue med so hopefully that’ll work out, and I’m also starting a new preventative soon…fingers crossed. If you have any questions or concerns feel free to ask!\n",

      "After 2 weeks of full time migraines and a whole lot of rizatriptan + Tylenol, had an appointment with my pcp, who always wants to play the guilt game with me asking if I changed my eating, sleeping, and exercising or stress habits. I haven’t. I ask her if we can try one of those medicines they show on tv all the time… they seem so magical… Then she proceeds to prescribe me PREDNISONE, saying a “shock of anti-inflammatories” will send the migraine away and then we can start a new treatment with 100mg of topiramate and Naproxen. Thing is. I have a history of gastritis (especially with NSAIDs) and anxiety. She knows. I point out and ask if the prednisone won’t mess up my stomach, to which she responds “no, just take it with food”. I know food won’t do it, but oh well, she’s the doctor. She also warns me that the 100mg of topiramate can make me feel “a little jittery”, so it’s better to take it during the day. Cut to yesterday. I spent the whole effing day with the worst pain in my stomach, thanks to the prednisone gastritis, and had my 4 limbs numb as f*, followed by a panic attack sponsored by the topiramate. Then I called her office this morning and she said I should go to the ER to get an IV for the migraine. GO TO THE ER, because apparently she can’t provide me treatment. I can’t even put it into words how mad I am at this woman. She has all my medical history and she still prescribed me things that SHE KNEW it would make me feel bad. And now here I am, day 17 with migraines, no help from the one person who should help me, trying to find a new doctor, because I’m DONE with this stupid reckless useless doctor who seems to want to use me as a guinea pig.

      "Topiramate - epilepsy drug - titrate slowly (start at 25 mg per night and increase by 25 mg every two weeks to an initial target of 50-75 mg)  My notes: (25mg of 60 tablets = $25 approx.) Titrate slowly perhaps from 12.5 mg over long period, to reduce side effects, which are many and concerning, weight loss a concern. Topiramate blocks voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels. It also inhibits the excitatory glutamate pathway while enhancing the inhibitory effect of GABA. Moreover, it inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity. 17 prospective, controlled trials of topiramate were included in this analysis. Nine of these studies compared topiramate with placebo and found that it reduced headache frequency by 1.2 attacks per 28 days (mean difference = −1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.59 to −0.80). Patients taking topiramate daily were more likely to report a 50% or more reduction in headache frequency compared with patients taking placebo (relative risk = 2.02; 95% CI, 1.57 to 2.60). Serum calcium concentrations were significantly lower in patients receiving topiramate than in those receiving valproate. Use of topiramate is associated with lower parathyroid hormone and bicarbonate concentrations along with mild hypocalcemia and increased bone turnover, which suggests that topiramate may have long‐term effects on bone. Therefore, taking Calcium Carbonate helps with the side effects of metabolic acidosis caused by Topiramate. Usual adult dose for Hypocalcemia - 1250 mg orally 2 to 3 times a day with meals. I also suffer from functional dyspepsia. Recommended calcium carbonate for dyspepsia dose: 1000 to 3531 mg orally up to 4 times a day as needed. This ties nicely. Topiramate in comparative research slightly more effective than Sodium Valproate.\n",

      "Sure!  I've probably commented about this a million times because it was so remarkable for me.  I got into ketosis 5 years ago.  I was very strict to start (20 net carbs per day) but after induction I found I could go as high as 35-40 net carbs and not trigger a migraine.  In terms of impact, it was pretty incredible.  My baseline is 16-18 migraine days/month and when at this level of ketosis I had maybe 1-2 a month.  I did that for 2 years and then started playing around a bit with my treatment plan.  For the last 3 years, I've done modified keto which was the result of a bit of a fluke - I was in Europe for vacation and bought Metformin, the diabetes drug, because it is sold over the counter there.  I knew there was a clinical trial at Mayo looking at Metformin for migraine treatment and I knew that blood sugar was a primary trigger for me, so I was curious if it had any impact.  Based on the results of my own little trial, I eventually fessed up to my doctor and asked for a prescription, which she was fine with writing.  For the last 3, I am eating strict keto in the mornings (when my blood sugar seems least stable) - so 2tsp mct oil for breakfast with my tea, a grass-fed buttered decaf coffee 2 hours later and a low carb-high fat lunch.  But for the afternoon and dinner, I can eat just about anything and as long as I take a low dose of metformin (250mg) with the meal or snack, I don't trigger!  It's been such a nice balance because I love to cook and bake.  \n",

      "Hi Op, I’m so sorry for what’s going on. Are you on regular Topiramate or the extended release version? If you’re taking regular Topiramate I think you should see if your insurance will cover you for Topiramate ER and see if that’ll be more helpful for you in terms of side effects.  Has Topiramate lessened the severity of your migraines in any way? Could that be the reason your neuro has you still on it? In know in my case when I would complain to my neurologist about my migraines still occurring while I was first taking Topiramate he would ask me if they were less severe when they occurred and to be honest they were a bit less painful compared to when I wasn’t on it. There are tons of medications on the market and unfortunately you may have to go through a bit of trial and error to find what will work for you. Make an appointment with your neuro, really stress that what’s happening is deeply effecting your quality of life and that you need more options now. OP it does get better for the last year I dealt with constant migraines and I’ve considered dropping out of school and really going over the edge. However last month another medication was added to the combo that has really made a difference for me. I now currently take two preventives( Topiramate ER 200mg and Amitriplyine 25mg). Just keep going OP, you’ll find what works soon. I wish you all the best &lt;3.\n",

Then finally he said ok we'll double it and take some in the morning and some at night, I don't know alot about med's but something to do with half life and it wears off and only lasts like 6-8hrs so two dosages was getting me through the whole day and night. \n",

I jave felt so much better for the last 6mths not having to live with migraines and this has been especially helpful as I've also started a new job and I was cautious of the stress I might face after not working for so long and I honestly believe prosponsal has saved me.\n",

I’ve had stretches of 30 or more days without a migraine. The ones I DO have are significantly reduced in severity and duration. I feel pretty lucky in that I’ve experienced no side effects besides some itching at the injection site. I take a Benedryl right before I do the injection and that helps a lot; if I don’t the itching is pretty annoying. No constipation or weight gain for me.

Also, after the headache started, my fingers would go numb, sometimes all five, sometimes only ring and pinky fingers, but always only on one hand (sometimes left. sometimes right, but never both at the same time).\n",

Anyway that's wonderful you foudn a cure. Nortriptyline 10mg at night helps me a bit but I really worry taking it for years and years will give me significant cognitive declie, I'm not even 30 yet, and I intend on keeping taking it. I'm sure I could get off it some day if I really dedicated a ton of time getting off it. I don't want to do that burdensome thing right now. In the meantime my cognitive ability isn't horrible.

But I can’t eat when I’m having a migraine because I have severe nausea to the point I worry about keeping down water and my pill. So the naproxen stays unused. I have told my Dr all of this. Separately, I have a Rx for anxiety, 1 mg of clonazepam. I rarely use it because my mental health has improved and I know how to better manage my panic attacks. Sometimes I will take it with my imitrex when I am having a really bad migraine. It calms me and I really feel it helps with the Imitrex. I know this is not considered a Rx for migraines and I know it’s a controlled substance that can’t really be asked for because of its addictive properties and potential for abuse. I’m wondering if there was a way to bring it up to my Dr. I rarely use it, it’s only when there’s a full blown migraine and I am restless with the pain. I take it maybe once every few months so I’m not abusing it in that way, but I am not using it for its original intent. My question is; have you ever brought up different Rx’s or methods to your Dr about relief for your migraines? How did your Dr respond? I just don’t want to be seen as a patient that’s asking for drugs or trying to be their own Dr. but it does bring relief. And would love if my Dr could hear this without judgement. I hope this doesn’t break the rules. I tried to toe the line.

      "That's fairly high when used for migraines, my pills come in 10mg and I take 20mg nightly. I think I got up to about 50mg as the doctor advised me to slowly increase my dosage and basically to try to take the largest dose I could, he gave me the impression that it might cure my migraines. I started getting some extremely bizarre thoughts, but the migraines were less so I kept at 50mg for awhile, Eventually the strange thoughts just became tiresome and I tried to taper down; I got down to 20mg. I'm stuck there, I've tried to taper down farther but I can't because the migraines come back worse than before, it's unbearable. So I just kind of accept this shitty medication, because it kind of works sort of, I kind of got a little bit of my life back, the side effects really suck huge donkey balls but huge donkey balls are actually a slight improvement. Trying to taper down again is completely unimaginable; I can't go through that again, so here we are. Sucking donkey balls, and trying to tell myself that donkey balls aren't so bad.

I seem to remember it helped against headaches and neck stiffness, but I did still have them and would have the occasional migraine with aura just like before. I remember I used to freak out if I forgot to bring the pills with me going away, or forgot taking them early enough in the evening. Not taking would give me headaches and very painful neck, and taking them too late meant I could sleep until 2 pm. I felt like half a person for years. As if I was constantly low on energy, physically and mentally. I believe I decided to start dosing down after 5 years. I needed to know if it was the amitriptyline. I dosed down the same way I dosed up, luckily didn’t feel more pain, but also didn’t really feel like myself, even on just 10 mg. I stayed on 10 mg for a couple of months before phasing it out every other day over another month. I felt noticeably less cloudy in my head after a week or so off it. There was a moment a few months down the road where I realised I was a new person, my family saw it too. I was of course still yearning for my old self, and what I to this day feel is a lost youth.

I realised the pattern to an increasing extent after quitting the minipill 5 years ago. I have not had an aura migraine since late 2018. Meaning there is some overlap with treatments and ending them. While taking amitriptyline I was also diagnosed with IBS, and apparently I was lucky since the amitriptyline should help with those discomforts. Well, I’ve had much less pain since quitting, and my latest flare up nearly 3 years ago was fixed over a few months while excluding some culprits from my diet. \n",

I have had days screaming in pain and vomiting from too much Naproxen+Paracetamol cocktail, yet I know the brain fog clears within 24 hours. On amitriptyline the brain fog would linger and creep up on me at random times during any day. I am feeling better than I can ever remember the past two months, due to finding a minipill again that has successfully prevented normal ovulation and period for two cycles straight.\n",

However, I did not listen enough when he said that one of my headaches is linked to my menstrual cycle (recently I realised probably 3 of them were) and how important it was that the minipill he gave me should stop my periods. Because it worked. After my second appointment I never went back. I had my acute medication and the other headaches were not as frequent anymore. I was mostly too tired and sleepy to be bothered by being tired and sleepy. \n",

Don’t start too many new things at once, it’s worth being patient(!) and go one by one - it’s true, some meds really take months to work. Do review your treatment plan at least once a year, and continue to track how you’re feeling on symptom free days. Being able to prove to yourself and future doctors that you took something and it worked until it didn’t is SO underrated!\n",

She was willing to write a prescription because it is such a safe and well tolerated drug.  There is a clinical trial at Mayo looking at using metformin for migraine treatment, so I'm hopeful that more people, especially those who know blood sugar swings trigger migraines, might have access to it.  \n",

I'm trying 4.5 g /day of ketone salts, which are bound to magnesium, calcium, and sodium.

      "I have a tolerance for naproxen sodium (Aleve) now lol, and generally need 600mg (1 prescription strength or 3 OTC) to even touch a migraine (physical pain is different, smaller doses still work for joint pain). It's normal to build of tolerances to medication. The upper daily recommended limit for naproxen is 1000mg (your doc may or may not go over this). Any dosages over what is directed on the bottle for OTC meds should be monitored/directed by/shared with your doctor. But to specifically answer your question, as long as you're following his advice, you'll be fine (but feel free to write him a paragraph of questions, YOU PAY HIM, he's obligated to answer them, protect yourself, doctors are people too). Naproxen is one of the \"gentler\" NSAIDS. As long as you use it sparingly and only take what you *need* you'll be fine. If you experience any stomach pain, obviously stop taking it and give your body some time off. When started to build a tolerance to the 600mg, I cut myself off of naproxen for half a year (and I wasn't even taking it more than twice a month or so). Genetics play a huge role in medication tolerance and addiction. My mom builds tolerances to medications really easily, so it wasn't a surprise for me. Just be aware and don't \"just take more.\" Your body can only handle so much. It may not be addictive, but it does not mean you can't build a psychological dependency on it.\n",

Not gonna be able to speak with my doc for a few months so I'm just gonna hope they don't get worse.\n",

      "Unfortunately it’s common for preventatives to become less effective over time. I commonly need to switch things up every 6-18 months. I also sometimes get short term spikes in migraines that calm down on their own in 1-4 weeks, so I usually wait it out a bit to see if I actually need to change my preventative regimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, that would be rather quick. Plus, 50mg 2x/day (100mg total) is the typical therapeutic dose for migraine. Topamax can take 2-3 months after tapering up to the therapeutic dose to reach full effect. So you may have had a placebo effect of sorts where you felt you were getting benefit, but are now back to typical. I’d follow up with your doctor and discuss a dose increase if you are tolerating it ok, then give it some time.\n",

Going from 80mg one day to zero another day is a very bad idea.

      "- First, I had to figure my abortives. Traditional migraine medicines like triptans or exedrin  didn’t do anything for me. The only thing that works I found  out were anti inflammatories like large doses (800 mg) of ibuprofen and stronger prescribed ones like diclofenac. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Then once I figured out how to stop them, I became more aggressive in preventing them. I figured out they had to do with any change in pressure and found the “WeatherX” app. It’s an app that tells you when the pressure is changing. They try to sell you these ear plugs that you are supposed to put in - which doesn’t help- but taking my abortive when I get the alerts does. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Next I wanted to get to the root of my problem.  My neurologist recommended me to a migraine specialist who noticed my migraines start in my neck. She referred me to a neck doctor who after scans found that I have an arthritic disc in my neck and an out of place nerve that when it gets inflamed scrapes against a nerve. Changes in pressure cause this inflammation- and this is why anti-inflammatories work. \n",
      "\n",
      "- The neck doctor prescribed pt on my neck. The exercises helped- but what made the biggest impact was the dry needling. Insurance won’t let me get dry needling done in perpetuity, so I sought out other treatments. I found a massage therapist trained in Chinese medicine who gives me an acupressure massage followed by “cupping”….sounds crazy, but she sets these glass cups on fire and puts it on my back then moves them around where I have inflammation….I’ve been doing this a year now once every 2-3 weeks, and my migraines have decreased like crazy. My alerts go off and I don’t get them any more. \n",
      "\n",
      "I told my doctors this and they all say “if it works stick with it”. One of them told me that Chinese medicine works a surprisingly high amount of times.\n",

      "Hi all, I am 25, with episodic migraine  (since childhood) and chronic fibromyalgia like symptoms in the neck. I would be pursuing grad school education abroad and really worried about coping with this pain which is so so much daily. Not pursuing it would be really sad for me because my whole life has been halted by the pain. I have been advised to take Gabapentin 100mg since my grad program is for 2 years. Nortryptiline did not suit me.  I am concerned about taking Gabapentin for so long and its withdrawal. IDK what to do honestly. Would be nice to hear you guys. Thanks.\n",

They said it wasn’t a common side effect so they didn’t think it was related but it was too soon after the injection to not be related in my opinion lol I’m so glad someone else experienced that too (I mean I hate you did but at least I’m not crazy)!

      "4.  I take low dose daily estrogen (birth control pill) without any breaks, thus preventing menstruation and the estrogen withdrawal migraines that I get.  These migraines are the most miserable of all for me.\n",
      "5.  I take 20 mg daily of Reactine (Ceterizine) for allergies, which prevents nasty sinus originated migraines from inflammation.\n",
      "6.  I take Diclofenac anti-inflammatory twice a day.  This drug is the same as topical Voltaren, and powered Cambia, which my neurologist gave me for migraine treatment,  but which doesn't do much.  The inflammation in my body (feet, neck, sciatica,  etc) tends to trigger the whole migraine response,  so trying to control overall inflammation is helful.\n",
      "7.  I take 20 mg Cipralex (antidepressant SSRI), for depression,  as there is a link between depression and migraines:\n",
      "https://www.healthline.com/health/migraine/link-between-chronic-migraine-and-depression\n",

Eventually it stopped working for me and my doctor said my body seemed to have built an immunity of sort to it. Took a lot of different meds before settling on a beta-blocker that has made the world of difference. The only issue now is finding a medication to help when I have a migraine attack. Most meds need to be taken before it starts and If you take it too late it doesn't work. Also, I had a dangerous interaction between Maxalt and my anti-depressants that nearly had me in hospital\n",

By inhibiting CGRP the medication is slowing down the muscles in your gut that move food/waste through the system. I found that stool softeners and fiber didn't do anything because they didn't address the movement problem.

I have had to take a triptan when I feel a migraine coming on a few times in the past year, but the migraines are stopped in their tracks before they start and I genuinely feel like I've got my life back!

After about 45 minutes it felt like a veil had been lifted off of my head and the pain subsided (from about an 8 to about a 4/5).   I md again this past Thursday without having a migraine and didn’t notice a big effect- except at night I did have some stomach pain and couldn’t sleep well.  Today, I woke up with a severe migraine- one of the worst I’ve had - I was not going to microdose but thought I had nothing to lose.  My migraine diminished  quite a bit within an hour, and I took half a painkiller and feel pretty decent right now.

So if that's not yet been a topic w/your doc yet, it may be worth checking into. In addition to having the conversation w/your doc about modifying your treatment plan to find something that works better (vs. taking meds that aren't doing the job well enough), it's probably worth asking how many they're comfortable with you taking, especially if you need more than one per attack. My prescription is for 18/month, and even if insurance didn't cover the other 9, which has been the case for me in the past, I'd just fill the remaining 9 using goodrx. Based on your mention of longer lasting attacks, maybe naratriptan/frovatriptan would be worth the ask (they do take longer to kick in, in my experience) or, if your insurance covers it, maybe ask about the gepant med that was also approved as a preventive, if you haven't already tried it? The longer half life and lack of rebound risk may be of benefit.\n",

      "Hello!  I have had a migraine since my car accident on Dec 4 2019 (well since the concussion kicked in 2 days after the accident to be exact).  I have not had a pain free day since.  My doctor and my team (pain specialist, Neurological nurse practitioner, Neurologist) have tried every concoction of medication to relieve the pain to date.  We have managed to get me down to a level 3 if I don't move, think or talk, remain in a dimly lit room all day (of course I am off work), and take 30 mg of Nortriptyline + 100 mg of Topimirate ( also known as Topomax) daily as well as a 50 mg pack of Diclofenac as needed.  I am unable to read beyond simple text or short emails like this, have too many triggers to mention that increase my pain and do some physio at home when I can (benefits have run out for now).  I do go for walks and listen to podcasts.  I have 2 frequencies of tinnitus and vertigo, memory and word finding issues, and disk issues in my neck so lots of other issues we are working on.  But in order to really get any traction in my recovery we need to deal with my migraine  pain.  I at least need some pain free days.  Botox has been suggested as an option to try.  I am looking for feedback not advice here please as I have a team of medical practitioners I trust (Acupuncture, Osteopath, Physio, Occupational Therapy, Counselor, etc) along with amazing family....but I do not know anyone at all who has experienced anything of what I am going through.  **Particularly Botox for migraine.  What can I expect in terms of relieve from pain....relief from medication and all it's side effects?**\n",

Before that we tried the usual culprits like Topamax 100mg (stopped because I didn't want cognitive side effects and my word finding was shit), propranolol (got to 120mg ER before we gave up on it, I got bumped up to 160mg anyway because I felt my performance anxiety decrease a lot and it incidentally treats my tachycardia, and the bullshit vitamins that don't work: magnesium and riboflavin. I'm surprised your team didn't try botox first because my insurance approved it after just two preventatives failed. My neuro said that if it works it'd start working after 3 weeks, but I honestly felt a difference the day after. I went from a daily migraine to getting 1 or 2 days pain free without having to take an abortive. It hasn't even been 3 weeks yet and my neuro warned me that a lot of people don't get relief until the 2nd or 3rd round. The more migraines you have the better it's supposed to work. I still think it's too early to say if it's working for me but I feel like it's the only thing I've tried that meaningfully moved the needle.

Don’t overdo it your first time, you can always add more, but you can’t take it away (then, in case you have any anxiety you haven’t overdone it.) Also, indica strains seem to work best for my migraines as they give the most body high (which relaxes me and helps ease the migraine.) Go for 1:1 THC:CBD because they kind of potentiate each other slightly (I.e. make the experience better together)\n",

I was on 50 mg twice a day. My doctor told me to only take it once a day for two weeks and then I could stop. Sunday morning was the last time I took it. I looked up the half life, and it should be mostly out of my body by now. I'm not sure if this is a withdrawal symptom that you can experience even with tapering?

Unfortunately cambria worked for me as a teen but no longer works now, and zomig nasal spray worked great but wasn't covered by insurance so I had to try zolmitriptan instead which so far works decently if I can catch it at the right time, nurtec and ubrevly did absolutely nothing for me.

I have too forced myself to do way more than I should have when I've had migraines with going to work, and working some jobs 5hat required me to stay on my feet and be constantly physically active.

The first months it didn't do anything with my migraine, but then I went a full 18 days without one. Once I finally saw a neurologist, he wanted to step me up to 200 mg, twice daily,  to see if we can completely get rid of them.  Well because my insurance didn't like the step up,  he prescribed be 100mg and 50 MG tablets and I somehow ended up stepping myself up to 300mg for over a month. 😳 That's when I started getting more side effects (other than losing taste of carbonated beverages) such as loss of appetite, lose stool, brain fog, fatigue, random bouts of depression. I think I'm lucky I'm already on Sertraline &amp; Gabapentin for anxiety or that could have been worse. \n",

      "My worst one generally comes right around this time. I dread it every year. It coincides with the onset of rainy season where I live. Last year it got so bad I convinced myself I was having a stroke. My right foot started twitching during the migraine (it's always my right side that goes numb), and it kept twitching until December. I thought it was MS, but after many neurology appointments, they waved me off with \"atypical migraine.\" This experience scared me enough to take to the internet and try basically anything I could find. \n",

I fell off the wagon from January to March, and the headaches came back. I restarted two weeks ago, and they are gone again. It is a strict diet, but the relief I'm getting from the migraines and just generally feeling better overall has made me consider I might just stay on it forever. I'm pretty sure my migraines are being triggered by something in my diet (I've eaten tomatoes three times in the past 6 months and each time I woke up with a cracking headache the next day... it's too much of a coincidence, so I've said goodbye to them permanently).\n",

The magnesium has definitely helped, not only for prevention but also to break up a migraine when it won't fuck off.  I'm not sure if the other ones are having an effect or if it's purely diet.\n",

      "Both Nurtec ODT and Emgality are CGRP targeting drugs with the main difference being that Emgality is administered as injections while Nurtec ODT is an orally disintegrating tablet. CGRP-targeting drugs have had a tremendous impact on the treatment for migraine and the American Association of Medical Colleges even referred to their use as “a new era for migraine relief.” With regard to tolerance and MOH (medication overuse headaches) – frequent use of triptans meds has been linked to MOH and can even make migraines worse. On the other hand, current evidence indicates that CGRP targeting meds will not cause MOH or tolerance. You can check out [this](https://www.everydayhealth.com/migraine/nurtec-now-approved-to-help-prevent-episodic-migraine-too/) link for key facts about Nurtec ODT and CGRP targeting meds. \n",
      "  \n",
      "One of the main drawbacks of Emgality is the possibility of injection site reactions. These reactions are pretty common and include everything from slight redness to severe pain and itching. To be fair, most of these events are mild to moderate in severity and subside without the need for intervention. One of the main plus points of Emgality is that you just need to take one shot a month which means that it has minimal impact on your daily life. However, many people would prefer to take a pill regularly rather than monthly injections. Nurtec ODT lasts for 48 hours and if necessary, can be taken every alternate day to prevent migraines. Clinical trials found that receiving 75mg of this drug every other day resulted in a significant reduction in the number of monthly migraine days. More importantly, 48% of those who received the drug had at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the number of moderate to severe migraine days per month.

I just wanted to add to this discussion that after a few years of keto, I added in a new treatment plan based on the fact that the keto was working well.  I bought some metformin (the diabetes drug) while in Europe because it was sold over the counter there.  I found that I could take a low dose of metformin when I am eating in a non-ketotic way and I still don't get a migraine!  I eventually told my doctor what I did and she was fine with prescribing me off label.  I take up to 750 mg of metformin each day and I can still eat the occasional slice of pizza or birthday cake and be fine.  I've been using metformin for migraine prevention for about 3 years now.\n",

There were multiple stages to this and kind of a shotgun approach that makes it so I don’t really know what exactly is working and what may be unnecessary? With that said, I’ll share my story. \n",
      "I’m in my late 50’s and have head headaches all my life. I discovered immitrex around age 30 and it really changed my life. Debilitating headaches became minor inconveniences. It just worked and that was amazing! However, I became pretty dependent on it. Always having that struggle of whether to take one or not, struggling to get as many as I needed (Kaiser allowed 9-100 mg pills per month land I could split them in half and supplement with two Advil and 95% of the time it knocked my migraines out. Whenever we went to Mexico I would by a couple bottles which was great. \n",
      "Except I was always worried about being dependent and rebound headaches. The usual stuff. So I’ve been trying to find the right cure for years and years and tried EVERYTHING! I’ve gone off cold turkey a few times but eventually I start back and find the same groove. \n",
      "Now that the history is over, I’ll share what happened. I started noticing that my normally low blood pressure was getting kind of high. Slight concern but didn’t phase me much. Then Kaiser reached out and said that people with high BP have worse outcomes with COVID-19 so maybe I should do something about it. At that point I went cold turkey off immitrex again and also started taking something for blood pressure. Simultaneously my wife had sent my hair in for a mineral analysis (part of the never ending search) and while the guy was still awaiting results, he said in the meantime you should drink water with salt and potassium every day. Also he suggested a form of magnesium I hadn’t tried before (and I’ve tried many). \n",
      "So, between the salty potassium water (1/4 tsp of each in a 20 oz. cup twice a day) and the magnesium my headaches nearly went away. Then my Dr. changed my BP meds to one that also had a beta blocker component and at that point I was indestructible for about two months. \n",
      "I could drink, or eat anything or do all of the usual triggers and I was fine the next day!\n",
      "After about two months, it lost some of the magic and I will still occasionally get a headache, but I haven’t had a migraine some mid February! I also haven’t (and hope to never) taken immitrex since then. \n",
      "So, what worked and what’s fluff? Hard to say. I’ve tried almost all of these things in the past. I’ve had magnesium. I’ve tried beta blockers. I didn’t always have high blood pressure. I’ve never tried the salty water, nor this specific combination of things. Personally, I feel like it’s the salty water and to some degree this specific beta blocker and probably this specific magnesium form. \n",
      "Of course everyone is different and the odds of this working are slim, but hey maybe there’s something in here for someone. \n",

      "No not every day. Ubrelvy is an abortive medication not a preventative so I take one as soon as I get the first sign of the migraine and it usually takes care of it pretty quickly. If needed I can repeat with a second pill. I have to do that probably about 20% of the time.\n",
      "Ubrevley comes in 50MG and 100MG. When I was started on the 50mg I almost always had to dose with the 2nd pill for full relief but then my headache specialist switched me to 100mg and the single pill usually does it for me.\n",

Started sweating and almost passed out from the pressure and pain in my chest, head, and into my arms but had to keep working while wondering if I was having a heart attack. I was too afraid to ever try it again. They then moved me to Naratriptan and I am only able to tolerate the 1mg dose. But even that causes insane pressure in my chest and head, just less painful. Doesn’t fully get rid of the migraine so I only use it maybe once a month and just live with the head pain on a daily basis until I decide it’s worth the side effects to get some relief. No one has ever mentioned Nurtec to me, though. I’m definitely going to ask about it.\n",

We didn't see any changes in the frequency of my migraines/headaches, but I did stop sleeping 10-12 hours a night and moved back to something more reasonable.\n",

If I only take one, however, I don’t feel any dizziness unless I lay on my back for long periods of time (feels like you’re on a boat).

My neuro says it’s not supposed to wear off but she’s willing to give me 140mg if it keeps happening.  That said, the shot is easy to take and there are YouTube videos explaining how!  I had a migraine after my very first shot but none since.  Only side effect was constipation and that went away after month 3.

      "I recently started seeing a neurologist for migraines. He started me on sumitriptan but that didn’t help at all.  Now he has put me on 25 mg of topamax to prevent migraines and is open to increasing the dosage provided I see an affect and the side effects are not too bad. He is working on getting my insurance to approve me taking Nurtec. The topamax seems to be working to a degree. The severity of my migraines has reduced significantly, however, I am feeling increased anxiety. I’m wondering if the anxiety with eventually wear off or balance out. \n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’m currently tapering off topamax, and it was an absolute nightmare. I got no migraine relief (in fact they were much worse) and I started getting anxiety at around 100 mg. My doctor just kept upping the dosage until my I couldn’t take the anxiety anymore (this was at 125 mg and I had been on it for about 3 months). When I started tapering off the dosage, my anxiety turned into a strong urge to kill myself several times a day. It was like I almost didn’t have control over myself and I’ve been like this everyday for 2 weeks now. This drug is no joke and I wish I had never taken it. I’m almost tapered off of it and I’m wondering if I’ll ever feel normal again. I’m honestly afraid to try any other migraine drugs now even though I really need something...\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you’re able to find the right medicine for you, but please do listen to your body if you are already having bad side effects. I didn’t even have any anxiety at 25 mg...you might want to ask your doctor about it. I’m definitely curious if anyone else has an experience with their anxiety improving over time when they stuck with it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve been on Topiramate for 3 years now  and it’s significantly reduced my migraines. Can’t lie to begin with it was rough and the side effects were pretty brutal, but I think once you get over that it’s definitely worth it. I thought it stopped working at 100mg and wanted off the med, but my doc just increased it up to 125mg which is what I take now and honestly it’s meant I can actually function every day without a constant ponding head.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Alright so a little background story... I have been seeing a neurologist since I was 9 years old for horrific migranes. Was initially put on topimax which worked but only for a few years after constantly increasing the dose. I have been on about all migraine medications and have finally found something that works great for me. I have been taking the Emgality 120mg/mL injection for about 6 months now. My first dose was double (2 of the 120mg/mL shots), and after that has been a single dose. I have got to say after switching neurologists and getting a second evaluation I have finally found this miracle shot. I have got to say, the first month wasn’t perfect but i noticed results very fast. Going in to my 7th month of Emgality I have very minimal migranes, rather i don’t have any, I only get little tension headaches, nothing compared to a migraine. \n",

Plus things like Advil/Tylenol/Naproxen don’t do anything on their own for my headaches. I tried taking Naproxen with Rizatriptan for a little bit but I didn’t notice that much of a difference between that and the rizatriptan alone. I now have 10mg Maxalt dissolve tablets that seem to work pretty well. \n",

Using the neck pillow seemed to stop all my head weight from going on the normal pillow.\n",

I'm also on 8mg of Candesartan a night (freaked my doctor out as my blood pressure actually rose when I went on that) &amp; 10mg of amitriptyline of a night too. Along with B12, magnesium &amp; vit D.

Then I was put onto stronger dose of painkillers, that didn't help in fact that gave me rebound headache which was awful. \n",

I've been swinging between mild mania and slight paranoia, and I've been having a lot of anxiety and feeling of impending doom since I started it. These aren't the only side effects, but they're definitely the ones I'm most concerned about (I have a history of anxiety, depression and ADHD-related emotional dysregulation). I'm definitely gonna talk to my doctor about it, since I know you shouldn't stop taking it abruptly or without guidance, but I'm just curious if anyone knows how much tapering needs to be done at a dose that low and what to expect from the process.\n",

      "This also happens to me and I understand what you are talking about. I am generally a very cheerful and optimistic person but the migraines very directly cause me to have a down mood. I understand what you are talking about with the dissociation and derealization in relation to migraine. Those aspects are my least favorite aspects of migraine effect. I have found some things to help immensely: \n",
      "1) Dissociation and Derealization can happen to people who suffer from trauma as a defense mechanism psychologically but this is not what is happening to you. I found myself trying to make sense of my migraine related phenomena on a psychological level but I just gave myself undue anxiety trying to dig into the whole thing as if there was some kind of underlying psychological explanation which made what was happening to me make sense. I thought maybe subconsciously I had this for response causing dissociation when my body knew I was getting a migraine before I did. I thought maybe I suddenly get depressed because I am subconsciously dissatisfied with something... etc. etc. All of this just messed me up psychologically, basically doubling the burden of this neurological disease. I deal much better now that I have accepted that this is a serious neurological disease and it doesn’t make sense to try to find some kind of reason for it psychologically. If I dissociate and get horrific headaches without reason, I need to just accept it. There is dissociation the psychological phenomena and migraine induced neurochemical dissociation and it will cause you undue pain to confuse them, and actually you may even cause yourself some of the former just with anxiety about the fact that you feel you are psychologically “causing” the latter. The depression which comes as a result of migraine processes I just accept as a neurological issue and it goes away much faster.\n",
      "2) I have had few things help majorly: vitamin b2, ketogenic diet, and drinking 500mg salt water when I notice this stuff happening. Migraines have a variety of causes but for me something is definitely wrong with my mitochondria and energy production in my brain. Vitamins b2 cut the dissociation episodes a lot and the eyegraines and constant head pressure slash headaches. I take 400mg once a day. I have only been on keto for three weeks but while I still get headaches my eyegraine pain and visual disturbance (which for me is very connected to the dissociation and vertigo like feelings, have been greatly reduced in strength and frequency. I hate keto to be honest with you. I have a passion for cooking so this diet is miserable but that should indicate how much suffering migraines put me through and how much relief keto represents. For the salt water, it sounds stupid but it really does seem to stave off some attacks.\n",

I was on a 25mg dose in 2019 but stopped taking it because it wasn’t working and the side effects were awful, but my doctor put me back on it on 50mg in October 2020 and it’s been working since then (I did however loose my appetite as well this time around which didn’t happen the first time)\n",

      "Been experiencing more frequent migraines for the last 6 months or so and my doctor prescribed me 50mg sumatriptan at my physical last month. Finally got a doozy yesterday to give it a try. Woke up and told my BF I was “kinda headachy” he brought me the usual, sleeve of saltines, water, Nuun, and coffee. Within 90 min I went from kinda headachy to wrapping my arm over my head to make my eyeball feel like it wasn’t going to explode out and wanting to puke. Super here we go. Had my BF prep me up one of the new sumatriptan tablets and read the papers about side effects. (Was kinda scared of the cardio side effects. Dr said it was really safe pharmacist said go easy on it she felt her blood pulse up and down her arms… uh yikes.)\n",
      "  \n",
      "Snoozed for 90min - 2hr (BF sat on the bed next to me quietly on his laptop to keep an eye on me) and woke up relatively headache free! Yes! I was sweating buckets and at one point felt a warmth flow over me but could at least open my mouth and speak full sentences without wanting to vomit and could concentrate on text long enough to catch up on Reddit and YouTube. Had a long chat with my mom on the phone. Thought I was good to go!\n",
      "  \n",
      "Sometime after dinner maybe 10hrs later I felt a faint headache coming back. Watched a movie and by bedtime 12-13hrs later it was full up headache but not migraine. BF asked if I wanted to take something and I really wanted to see how I would do sleeping it off. (Mistake 1)\n",
      "  \n",
      "Here I am, woke up 2 hours earlier than normal migraine is back but not quite as extreme as yesterday (can talk and read in short bursts). I decided to take Excedrin 2 hours ago because the sumatriptan obviously didn’t take the whole thing out yesterday. Excedrin usually takes 3-4hrs if it helps me at all. Ugh. \n",
      "  \n",
      "I’m confused about the 2nd dose of sumatriptan though. The leaflet says take 1-2 at onset (took 1 to start) and if it comes back after 2 hours take 1. At 2 hours I was fine. 10 hours is when it came back. Do I start over with 1-2 or take 1 as a 2nd dose? They only gave me 9 tablets per month! I confirmed my insurance will cover 18 if my brain is that stubborn. \n",

      "I've been taking sumatriptan for years so I can relate. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first issue I see here is coffee.  Caffeine is a known migraine trigger and usually if I'm at a point where I need suma, coffee will only prevent it from working effectively.  It's gotten to a point now where I know I'm going to have a migraine because my morning cup of coffee doesn't taste right.  I dump it and walk away because I know I'm going to pay for it if I keep drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second issue I can see is that with triptans, the earlier you take it, the more effective it'll be.  You should've taken it when you were getting ready with other things (crackers, etc.).  If you wait too long you risk the medication only knocking it out for a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue I see is dosage.  I feel like this is the most tricky part.  You'll get good at gauging it though.  When you have minor symptoms where you know it's coming but can basically still function, take a smaller dose.  This let's you tackle it early, which is necessary, but doesn't run the risk of rebound migraines that you can get if you take too much, which might be what happened to you.  Honestly I'm surprised your doctor didn't start you with 25mg instead.  If I were you, next time I'd cut that pill in half when you feel minor symptoms coming on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 9 pill a month thing is a nightmare to deal with when you're a chronic sufferer.  One doctor I had told me to just request 100mg pills and cut them up to smaller doses as needed.  I guess you're not supposed to do this, but I've been doing it for around 10 years now and it really is necessary to be able to change the dosage based on severity and to prevent rebounds.  Until insurance stops being cheap assholes this is the option we're left with.\n",

Is this dose large enough to actually do anything or is it just a starter dose until it gets raised later?  For those of you who take Amitriptyline and get some benefit from it, did 10mg actually help or did you have to keep raising the dose?  I think my doc intends to just keep me at 10mg because I'm only trying this to get my insurance to cover Emgality, but it would be nice if it works.\n",

      "I'm currently on 10mg and it did help significantly (going from multiple headaches a day to having some pain free days every so often). I doubt I can go up given that I'm already scoring some pretty annoying side effects but I am usually pretty sensitive so that's no surprise. So it is definitely possible that it can have an effect but like with all meds, YMMV. I hope it works for you.\n",

      "\n",
      "Note that for an Emgality prior authorization, insurance will likely look at dose in addition to medication and time tried.  I actually just got prescriptions for Amitriptyline and Propranalol to aid in a future Aimovig prior authorization re-appeal.  I tried them previously (and didn't find either effective or tolerate them well), but didn't have detailed enough medical records for them or any of the specific meds in the PA criteria, so they denied my PA, and my appeal.  The PA criteria stated it needs to be at an effective dose for at least 6 weeks, so I looked up the therapeutic doses, so I could be sure to request that from my doctor.  To be honest I'm not actually taking either, I just filled the prescriptions so I have the receipts, and will report back to the doctor they weren't effective (based on my previous trials, so it's not really a lie), so I have the records.  I've continued on Aimovig, paying out of pocket, then a 3 month free bridge program coupon, and I'll probably need to pay out of pocket at least another month (and hopefully get insurance to reimburse me once they approve it).  So you may want to go back in to the doctor and ask about increasing the dose, assuming you are tolerating it ok, as it'll save you time in the long run vs. getting a PA denied, needing to re-trial something, then needing to appeal.\n",

I do full keto diet for the first half of every day (mct oil, buttered coffee etc) but after lunch, I eat pretty regular food and as long as I take a low dose of metformin, I don't trigger a migraine.  \n",

      "Hi! I'm a 22 year old female. I have a family history on my maternal side of a grandmother and uncle with Multiple Sclerosis. My mom has degenerative disc disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. I had a febrile seizure at 18 months of age. Since then I've had a relatively healthy life. I have a shellfish allergy, allergy to something in bathbombs, and a sun sensitivity. Starting in November 6th I started to have a headache which hasn't gone away since. CT, and MRI were normal and Lumbar puncture was finally done and so far the results we received were normal. In February I started having seizures (not entirely sure what kind I think simple partial) now I've been seizure free. My original neurologist wanted to diagnose me with a migraine which I definitely don't agree with. They already tried two migraine preventative medications,  gabapentin for neuropathic pain, migrelief, vitamins etc. My new neurologist is thinking it's autoimmune but we haven't done further testing. He started me on prednisone and low and behold I have so much energy! After bumping it to 40mg and going about my day I felt a significant difference after 5pm. So for the majority of the day my head pain was decreased! What I'm reaching out to you guys about is what could this be???? Has anyone had an autoimmune disease like this?

I run / exercise a lot, even through the worst of my migraine symptoms. And it seems a lot the side effects, from joint pain to burn muscle, etc, would stop that?

During high school/college/post college I played competitive basketball and took sumatriptans and usually had no issues with side effects.

The amitriptyline has not helped my migraines at all, even though I've been sleeping like a baby ever since I started it (for real - I wish I'd been prescribed this earlier when I went in for insomnia, it's so much better than the ssri I was given). I've been on it for six weeks, and my doctor says I need to have been on it for 3 months before I try a different preventative (probably topiramate). \n",

Also I'm pretty sure you have to try way more things before they refer you on because of NICE guidelines.

It was a game changer when I started the drug coming down from half the month of migraines to 2 or 3 a month.  Every time I went off of it I had to hurry up and get pregnant because while pregnant I didn’t have many migraines/headaches but the time spent trying to get pregnant without the topiramate was always hard.  I use naratriptan for break through migraines that typically come around my period.  The initial side effects for me were tingling in my hands and feet and bad taste in carbonated beverages. Those were only transient effects. I take 100 mg.  Everyone reacts differently to meds, you have to keep trying until you find what’s right for you.\n",

      "I have love/hate relationship with Topamax. I've been on and off it for 17 years. It definitely helps my migraines. It also helps me lose weight. You mentioned weight gain from propranolol so that might be a positive.  On the downside, it makes my hair fall out and makes me a zombie. It also made my hands and feet tingle but that didn't bother me much. It would come and go. Just a note if you're female- it can interfere with birth control at higher doses.\n",

      "That's my experience. I'm really sensitive to medication side effects. Everyone is different. I have a friend who takes 200 mg/day and she functions well. You never know until you try it! Start low and go up slow. Also taper off slowly if you need to stop taking it. I was always started at 25 mg/night and increased by 25 mg each week as tolerated.\n",

      "If you try it and can't tolerate it, Trokendi is a similar medication. There's no generic, but it's supposed to have less cognitive side effects. Zonegran is also an option.

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My migraines are well controlled by topomax. However I still occasionally the cold triggered ones and attempting to up the dosage to 100mg a day caused too much paresthesia in my feet.

I log each attack and the data shows a night and day effect of the drug for me. \n",

      "Main side effect has been some sort of cough which responds to Benadryl, so I think I have some sort of minor allergic reaction to one of the inactive ingredients. I looked it up and seems like it’s a pretty minority side effect. I think basically always being in a state of predrome or postdrome was giving me ADHD like symptoms. So much easier to focus now that I’m not constantly rocked by migraines every few days.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "When I first started Topamax I got some pretty bizarre side effects at night.  So I started tapering off the drug, but during the taper I found that at a low dose the side effects went away and the medication was still helpful in reducing migraines.  I stopped at that dose (37.5 mg - one and a half 25 mg pills at bedtime) and it’s been helpful for a long time without any noticeable side effects.  I think with this drug you just have to be prepared to change dosages very slowly by very small amounts.  But it did make a noticeable positive difference for me.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can also speak to this. Topamax absolutely helped reduce the the frequency of my migraines. But the side effects are real. I went slowly up to 100mg/day but started to wean back down when the side effects got to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would've probably stayed at around 25-50mg/day but I was able to drastically reduce my migraines with some lifestyle changes so I was able to get off the Topamax completely. I'm glad I'm not on it anymore but it definitely helped.\n",

      "\n",
      "The dizziness started out strong - it was like being on a rollercoaster. Fun for two days. It got tiring really fast, and made the tension worse (or so I believe - the neurologist disagrees and believes that worsening was the effect of going off of nortriptyline). The dizziness was strong for two weeks. I didn't feel sick in my stomach at all though, so I didn't mind it that badly. It was still quite noticeable until the end of the first month. Now I've been on it for about two months, increased the dose to 50mg from 25mg and my body still feels kind of funny, but it's so weak that I can do everything I could before the dizziness started.\n",

I do occasionally have a little trouble with finding words, but I have patience with myself and think around it. All this to say that topiramate has been incredibly helpful! I would gladly take the few odd side effects I have experienced for the drastic improvements in my migraines.

      "Hi, just found your post by searching for nerivio trying to see what others think of it.Your post reminds me of my wife, she's mid 30's now, but when she was a teenager she also started getting very bad headaches that lasted every day for months. You've mentioned a few times about eye pain. I don't want to assume you are the same as her, but if you feel like you have a fire-ery stabbing pain in your eye(s), you probably have what she has which is cluster headaches. I'm sure shes different from you because she also has had high thyroid hormone, and thats pretty rare, also she's never had depression.Anyway for her headaches she she took topiramate and tizanidine, with rizatriptan as needed (sumatriptan didn't work for her) for several years. But even then she still had headaches about once a month. A few months ago we decided we wanted to have a baby, and all three of those are bad for the baby so we explored new options.For migraines/cluster headaches she's taking magnesium oxide about 400mg daily, vitamin b2 200mg twice daily, a combination b vitamin (thats mostly for thyroid hormones related stuff). That alone has gotten rid of most of her headaches. But we also got a tank of oxygen since that has been shown to be helpful for cluster headaches, and it turns it out works great for her (about 4L/minute for 15-20 minutes as soon as she feels facial pain). Oxygen can be tricky to get a hold of, it take a lot of effort coordinating between insurance and oxygen suppliers to get it, and in the end, we only tried it because her grandfather happened to have an oxygen tank that he didnt use very much so it was easy to get a hold of. Besides that shes about to try nerivio since its the cheaper than cefaly and gammacore.You pretty much do need a neurologist to help coordinate everything and rule out more complicated diseases. And you especially need one since you take anti-depressants and those could interact with other medicines. Besides that, make sure you stay hydrated, Noritriptyline will dry you out. Try taking pedialyte, which is basically slightly salty water, it helped my wife feel more hydrated than straight water.\n",

My neurologist kept increasing my dosage if I tolerated it, and I got up to 300mg daily. I asked to back off of it after I started forgetting everyday words for my job, but it wasn’t awful.

I went from having maybe two migraines a week to having only one in the whole month (pretty mild too). I even felt much more clear headed just generally. I was ecstatic. The second month though... the frequency seems to have jumped back up again. Not quite to the levels beforehand, but still a fair bit: I seem to be getting them weekly now.\n",

Interested to hear anyone elses experiences with this? It really affects my exercise tolerance which I'm finding to be quite a downside, so trying to feel out if it's something that's going to be worth it long term or not...\n",

It could be unfortunate timing, but last week I got one a day after my second COVID19 vaccine and it was horrible. I knew it was coming and tried the torodol my doctor just prescribed. Well, that didn't work while I was in my prodome phase. So even before my vaccine, it does seem to be losing effectiveness.\n",

At this point I'm getting pseudo seizures and still no headache relief. Finally the doc bumped it up to 100 twice daily with sumatriptan as needed. The topamax still was not working and was detrimental at that point so I slowly weaned myself off weekly by taking off 25 mg from the dosage.

      "My brother recently referred to me this remarkably good paper: [The metabolic face of migraine - from pathophysiology to treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31586135/). I have researched migraines for over a decade to try to resolve my own, and it's very rare that I come across a resource that clarifies and explains so many different pieces of the puzzle. I decided to summarize some key points of this article that I had not seen elsewhere, for the sake of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Migraine can be viewed as a metabolic disorder related to poor mitigation of oxidative stress, poor energy metabolism, or in some cases both. The migraine itself is a mammalian response to the brain falling out of oxidative and/or metabolic homeostasis. If you avoid allowing the brain's metabolic/oxidative stress level to fall out of regulation, you avoid the migraine.\n",
      "* The reason that migraines tend to pass down the female line much more frequently than the male line is that we inherit 100% of our mitochondria from our mothers, and inefficient mitochondria may be part of the problem. However, the paper is careful not to imply that inefficient mitochondria explains everything. Genetic analyses show that migraine is correlated with certain alleles in mitochondrial DNA, as well as some of your own genes.\n",
      "* Metabolic ketosis is often an effective intervention to treat migraine because it is an energy pathway that does not put the same pressures on the mitochondria. Regular exercise is also a successful intervention because it stimulates and helps regulate the mitochondrial and other energetic systems of the body. We've all heard that exercise is a good idea, but we've probably all had a really hard time implementing exercise plans, possibly *because* our bodies are particularly bad at energy metabolism, so that our brains \"run out of gas\" because we've worked out, and also we're remarkably bad at mitigating oxidative stress, meaning all the muscle damage overwhelms our body's capacity to remain in oxidative homeostasis, and so we get a migraine during the recovery/healing phase.\n",
      "* Migraine used to be known as \"hypoglycemic headache\" because this connection to low blood sugar and poor energy metabolism was apparently known for about a century, but seems to have been underemphasized recently.\n",
      "* With regards to oxidative stress, taking antioxidant supplements actually seems to work. With regards to energy metabolism, certain supplements effectively help with mitochondrial function. The paper provides the following list of supplements along with dosages which are proven, to one degree or another, to be statistically effective at reducing migraine:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;400mg Riboflavin  \n",
      "400mg CoQ10  \n",
      "600mg ALA (alpha lipoic acid)  \n",

      "400ug B12  \n",
      "?? Niacin / B3  \n",
      "500mg Magnesium oxide \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it is a very good paper in terms of organizing a lot of tidbits of information you may have seen before into a coherent story about the how and why, and connecting this story up with well-supported treatment recommendations.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I get nauseous, but the migraine does that, too, so I take an anti-nausea med. But then there's the side effects that make triptans not worth it for me: I'm unable to walk for the first hour after taking it at least, feel like there's an elephant sitting on my chest, I'm very dizzy, my brain feels like cotton candy, I'll be incessantly, but incoherently babbling for hours, and the triptan only takes an edge of the headpain.\n",

I've never heard of this medication being given \"as needed\"... like the other poster said, it has to reach and maintain a therapeutic level in your system. It's not an automatic drug that blasts away a migraine... it works over time at preventing them.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I took propranolol for maybe a year as a preventative. 60mg at night time so the side effect kick in when I’m asleep I assume. And they bumped it up to 80mg for the last couple months. \n",
      "I also took it for tachycardia which helped a lot. \n",
      "I guess propranolol took the edge off of the migraines, but at the end my migraines came back with a vengeance like I’ve never experienced before. But the vengeance was not caused by propranolol but by something new. Since I became bedridden we had to treat my migraines more aggressively so I was taken off propranolol and put on topamax. Overall I’d say I’m glad propranolol was the first preventative I was on. The side effects were tolerable (cold feet/dizziness if I stood up too fast) especially compared to the side effects I’m experiencing with topamax right now. I’m now experiencing a lot of tachycardia the propranolol was also treating and I’m considering bringing this up because it really interferes with my quality of life. \n",
      "Regarding the taking it as needed, I’ve only heard of people taking it as needed for things like stage fright? So probably for us migraine sufferers, daily is the staple.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Note this can take around a month at a therapeutic dose to have any potential benefit on migraines, and often it isn't started at the therapeutic dose.  Doctors often don't tell us this, but have plans to increase it if tolerated on a follow up visit.  The minimum published therapeutic dose is 80 mg/day.  So once a day for a week would likely only be helpful to gauge any potential initial side effects.  I'd follow doctor instructions on dose and frequency if you want any chance of this being effective for migraines.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pharmacist can be a good resource on possible medication side effects.  Plus you can always look up the full prescribing information, with percentage occurrence of each potential side effect.  But I'm not aware of it affecting mood or mental health.  The most common side effect is dizziness when standing, as it drops blood pressure.  Worst case you can always stop it (assuming you are still on the starting dose, or else you may need to taper down).  This is one of the most benign migraine preventative options, and well tolerated by most, especially at starting doses.\n",

It only lasts for 3 months, so even if anything did go slightly wrong, it'll go away in a few months.

I tried to use controlled, diaphragmatic breathing as much as possible (deep controlled breaths from the belly, not chest), and just focused on slowing down as much as possible. I learned a lot of mindfulness skills to try and be more focused in the present moment. The main goal of my life during this few months became just doing everything as slowly as I could stand. I also would do stretching/foam rolling almost daily which would naturally help me breathe slower and relieve much of the anxiety and muscle tension. As the anxiety decreased, the headaches decreased.\n",

Usually when I would start the shift I'd have a lot of anxiety and have a headache but sometimes I just knew I had to push through. Usually mid-way into the shift a lot of the anxiety would go away and I'd have little or no headache, or it wouldn't bother me.\n",

I'm glad she did because it delayed the tolerances I've built up to other medications (for example, I had to stop taking naproxen for six months because I was needing 800mg for it to work and the daily max is 1000mg). Choose the method that will cause your body the least trouble: sleep, food, water, ice, etc. I wear shades when necessary, don't drive if I have vertigo, and just work around my migraines when they aren't bad. By doing that, I was able to manage them without a neuro for a while until my body decided it wanted to throw hands.\n",

The tingling has been acting up a little the past few days but I think it’s because I haven’t been getting good rest. My kid peed our bed one night so we had to shower, next night my niece spent the night and we were up late, then the next it took me awhile to put my daughter back down in her bed. Anyway I’ve noticed this week like all week I’ve had a bit of a stomach ache. TMI but my bowel movements are like usual but it’s like this constant dull ache and I can’t eat as much as usual, which may be good (maybe I’ll lose some weight because I could stand to). But I don’t particularly care to hurt to do that. I also feel like my stomach is kinda bloated and in the evening my acid reflux flares up. I take 20mg of omeprazole daily for it and it’s been in check for the longest now. Seeing I have acid reflux and an iffy stomach anyway I didn’t know if this was a Topamax thing or a me thing but until lately my stomach had been fine. Just this week it has been acting up. Oh and also while I’m thinking about it too, does Topamax make anyone itchy? I’ve been kinda itchy lately especially after a shower. Any input is appreciated.\n",

Topamax doesn't bother my stomach, which is pretty sensitive. I sniff the wrong food and I get reflux. But, I have known people who started having reflux issues when they first began Topamax. They took Omeprazole for awhile and eventually it sorted itself out. It's possible this could go away. Talk to your doctor. It's possible you can take your dose at a different time, I take mine before bed, but also good to let them know about the itching. You want to make sure you're not having an allergy.\n",

While I know  symptoms can fluctuate depending on the type of migraine issue, even if I put the ringing aside, I've spent a lot of the past six weeks *VERY fatigued most days, with some brain fog, with more muscle cramps (especially in my neck and legs), more anxious, more emotional, even with more headaches, and just generally feeling crappy/out of it.* Given the timeline, I've naturally wondered if the nortriptyline is causing this. Within the past few months, I've also begun acupuncture, TMJ treatment and PT, all of which seem helpful (by tracking my symptoms there also seems to be a strong correlation, in my case, to muscle-related issues causing the tinnitus episodes)...still, I haven't been able to shake the feeling that the nortriptyline is weighing me down. I know I could be wrong, but I also know the only way I can be sure is by getting off of it for a few weeks. I discussed with my neuro and, while she clearly wanted me to increase the dose instead, supported my decision; so, for the next two weeks (I'm going to start this at the start of next week), she wants me to take the 10 mg capsules every other night, then I'll do two weeks off it completely, and then report back. **So, while I know 10 mg is a comparatively low dose to begin with, can anyone here speak to any issues they've noticed when tapering off nortriptyline?

He told me to stop taking it, but I’m still feeling a mild version of some of these symptoms over a week later (and I was only taking 10mg of the suggested 20mg dosage).

However 60mg is the lowest of the ER capsules and I’m nervous about stopping it after that without easing with lower amounts.

I was diagnosed with migraines last year and since have been on a preventative (atenaol 50mg) &amp; imitrex as needed. Things have been going great but since last 5/1 I've had a migraine that just keeps coming back. I went to my neurologist today (also epileptic) and they gave me a migraine injection and some type if pill. I came home passed out and it still hasn't gone away. \n",

      "\n",
      "I started seeing a new GP and she recommended that I take 5-10mg for my insomnia but also for my migraines. Then I started researching melatonin and migraines and there's a lot of studies with melatonin significantly reducing the frequency of migraines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is one study of 196 participants:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Results Mean headache frequency reduction was 2.7 migraine headache days in the melatonin group, 2.2 for amitriptyline and 1.1 for placebo. Melatonin significantly reduced headache frequency compared with placebo (p=0.009), but not to amitriptyline (p=0.19). Melatonin was superior to amitriptyline in the percentage of patients with a greater than 50% reduction in migraine frequency. Melatonin was better tolerated than amitriptyline. Weight loss was found in the melatonin group, a slight weight gain in placebo and significantly for amitriptyline users.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusions Melatonin 3 mg is better than placebo for migraine prevention, more tolerable than amitriptyline and as effective as amitriptyline 25 mg.**\n",
      "\n",
      "I found another study earlier as well and they used 6mg for migraines and it was significantly effective.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is so interesting, my neurologist had me undergo a sleep study, and found essentially that my system wasn’t producing enough melatonin. Since then I’ve taken 3mg every night, instantly fixed my sleep cycle (I used to be up from 2 am to like 4 am previously). And of course as a result I had significantly fewer morning migraines. Also since I’m well rested, my migraines are much less severe - my Neuro explained it as sleep being a reset for the body including the pain receptors - which apparently are constantly misfiring for me! Haha \n",
      "\n",
      "Melatonin secretion is lowered as we use more devices and more screens, so he had me turn off all devices an hour before bed, switch to warmer dimmer lighting, and that’s the only way the melatonin pill works for me. If I take the pill, and am on my phone - it’s not gonna work. And voilà the next morning, I’m back to having a raging migraine. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do take other prophylactics as well, but melatonin literally the day I started taking it - I was like I found a magic pill!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ha now that you mention it I've been popping 30 mgs of melatonin every night (I know that's a lot but I was having a terrible time sleeping after relocating due to the pandemic) and at some point my migraines started to dramatically improve! I was wondering why that was, guess that might be it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "10mg?  (I have to check b/c I used to have 5 but that wasn’t working so I’m pretty sure I upped to 10.)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "What sort dosage are you using? I read in a study that under 3mg doesn't do much for migraines. 6mg is the sweet spot for migraines. 10mg for insomnia. I'm doing 5-6mg It's helping my insomnia but I've only started for 3 days, most of the studies are like over 3 months.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can't tolerate prednisone as it makes me super manic and an emotional basket case but my neuro prescribed dexamethasone. He said for a migraine that doesn't break with my abortive medication to take 8mg of dexamethasone. Since it is long acting I can just take one dose. It actually worked. I still had a few days of feeling edgy and not sleeping well but I feel that way and worse with a migraine so it's a win.\n",

      "I think mine is over for now. I took one triptan pill the night I got them and went to bed super early like 8pm. I woke up feeling not too bad, but then started feeling it come on again so I took another pill, waited 2 hours and took another. After that it cleared up. Yesterday I took no pills and felt really good, I could see well too. I just woke up today so I'll see how it goes. My triptan dose is pretty low I think 25mg. I also threw away a new matcha tea I bought a week ago since it's use happens to line up with my migraines. Might just be coincidence, but I'm not testing it. I hope yours breaks!\n",

      "Ice packs, penetrex cream or blue chamomile cream on my neck, do not lie down, try to walk a little, prop myself up on pillows, stay vertical as possible, if your insurance allows try ubrevly, it stops pain. Also an otc nausea medication called Nauzeen. I find lying down makes it worse. Also if possible I try to meditate for 10 minutes. It helps relax my neck and shoulders which clench hard w migraine, cutting off blood supply. B2 and magnesium at night before bed helped reduce migraine for me a LOT. If it starts getting into trigeminal neuralgia, 1000 mg b12 for a week, keeps it from coming back. \n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Topamax made me lose so much weight, and I was already thin to begin with. Amitriptyline has been so much more helpful for me. 100 mg of Topamax is a lot for migraine prevention. I think you should just go ahead and start weaning yourself off of it, and then tell them you want to trial something else for migraine prevention because it's affecting your ability to eat and keep weight on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edited to add you really should stick with the same neurologist tho. It's better to let them get to know you long-term than to see different doctors. Stick it out with them, and you'll likely have better results.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Im so sorry you are going through all this.\n",
      "I would try to get a different set of prescribers, especially if they are brushing you off and not taking you seriously. Topamax is one that needs to be tapered off, and can have serious side effects/withdrawal symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been taking amitriptyline (50mg) and topamax (175mg bid) for almost a decade for my migraines and it works for me. I never would have thought it caused my increase in depression and suicidal thoughts, esp when they become intrusive. Same with the brain fog. I've had those long before I started the meds. \n",
      "Sertraline (100mg) and Abilify (5mg) were recently added to my me list to assist with the depression.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "OH MY GOD. The “intrusive thoughts” and experiencing life far away (great way to describe it) is so so real. I have the thought of driving my car off the highway multiple times a day, and I have never been suicidal. If you talk to anyone, they would tell you I’m pretty much an upbeat person. Just last week my boss came out to me and ask if everything was okay and if I wanted to move forward with my career because he didn’t see the ambition in me he once did. He wasn’t being rude, he was genuinely like hey something isn’t right here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also I am SO tired. I work swing shift and I didn’t know if maybe that was just catching up to me but I am way more tired than I usually am. I’ve been drinking more coffee (which I try to limit myself to decrease the chance of migraines) to keep myself awake, but it doesn’t help... it’s like when you drink all this caffeine on 3 hours asleep... you just speed your heart rate up but your brain is asleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much for your answer. I genuinely thought maybe I was making things up in my head. I thought maybe just life was causing me to be extra stressed out, but I usually do well with stress. It has not been a good experience on this medication. My PCP put me on amitriptyline as one of the first preventives (only 25mg) but took me off as it didn’t work. Maybe I need a higher dosage and need to be on it longer.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had the same issue with topamax as well. After 2 weeks on the 100 mg dose, I had never been so unhappy in my life. I had a total flat effect. I hated it and insisted to my neurologist that I was lowering the dose of it starting the next day. \n",
      "\n",
      "One point that may be useful for you, I actually still take 25 mg. I don’t have any emotional side effects at that dose and it helps slightly with the pain.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take Topamirate Sandoz tablets (dont know if the brand makes a difference) and I have done some research on it. People who take a large dosis immediately or too fast instead of building it up very gradually, tend to feel depressed or experience severe side effects. Building it up gradually is starting out with 25 mg per day, after a week adding 25 mg, etc. until you reach 100 mg.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you did everything 'right' yet your body is telling you something is very wrong you should always listen to your body!\n",
      "\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I tapered off 150 at 25 mg a week but I had to sleep through most of it. If you know you want to go off of it I would ask about weaning off and is using the slow release capsules would be better than the regular ones. Best of luck to you\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "holy shit i relate so fucking much. i’m only on 50 mg but i’ve dropped 15 pounds in a month, i’m pissed scared or depressed all the time, and my kidneys literally hurt. not to mention numbness and tingling. and my doctor tried to tell me “that’s all normal when first starting topamax”. i need to get the FUCK off this stuff and you do too. i’m pretty sure i just have jaw issues too so the fact that this was my doc’s first thought to fix my headaches really pisses me off lol\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had to go to 3 neurologists before I found one who wasn’t an absolute dick. I think looking for a new one would be extremely helpful to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was on Topamax for years for my mood disorder. It actually helped tremendously with my depression. However, it also royally fucked up my skin (huge cystic acne all over my chest and back), gave me freaky vision trails in low light, made me extremely forgetful, and made my hands shake to the point of dysfunction. \n",
      "\n",
      "I started on 100 and went to 200mg over those years. Now, I’m absolutely NOT saying to stop taking it without direction from a doctor; however, whenever I am put in any medication, we have to start super low and increase slowly because I’m so sensitive to meds. I was able to drop to 150mg for a few days, then 100mg, and then nothing when I finally came off of it, and even then my psychiatrist said that the titration was out of an abundance of caution. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you find a neuro who doesn’t suck. I’ve been there and it’s so infuriating when someone who is supposed to be helpful invalidates your concerns like that. I think it’s something about how neurologists are wired, they’re small just know-it-all assholes.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "How long have you been taking the 100mg dose? I had terrible side effects at 50mg and had to stop after just 3 weeks. I don't think 100mg is a crazy high dose for tapering but I'm not a doctor. Maybe you can talk to your GP if you have a relationship with them? Hopefully you can find another neurologist! I have had neurologists like this and it's so frustrating to not be listened to. I hope you can find some relief soon OP.\n",

I am on Topamax 50 mg in the AM and 100 mg at night, Propranolol 160 mg at night, Magnesium 500mg and vitamin B2 every day.  I take Fioricet, Toradol, Zofran, and Benadryl at onset and it does nothing!  I end up in the ER every time!  I have tried every abbortive treatment I think at this point.  My insurance approved Nurtec recently and it did nothing.  I use to get them twice a week in high school then I went a phase with maybe once a month now I am doing once a week.  I have had numerous brain scans which showed something about basalar artery migraine, not sure what that is? I am a mom of three and these completely debilitate me to the point I can’t function at all.

      "Prior to my triptan overuse, an excedrin would take care of my more mild and medium attacks. Now I use a low dose caffeine tablet (100mg) if I feel pain coming on and it seems to do the trick. For some reason drinking caffeine doesn't help. It must be something about taking it in a pill. But in order to put an end to my triptan dependency I had to use excedrin for several days and ride out it out. I noticed the damage it was doing once I finally stopped taking them so often.\n",

      "I have been taking it for a couple years now, and I feel like my experience is one of the few positive ones based on how others have reacted to it. I take 50 mg at bedtime because the cognitive effects are very real, and this lessens them. I have been taking the same dose the whole time, and I rarely get migraines anymore. The ones I do get are much less severe than they used to be. I think I might not be as articulate as I used to be, but those side effects really diminished with time. The only lingering weird one for me has been paresthesia, and not eating makes it worse. Sometimes it’s so bad in my hands (it’s almost never my feet at all) that I drive kinda funny. I lost some weight since I started taking it, but I made dietary changes so it’s hard to say what caused it. I started taking the topamax when I started taking better care of myself and after I’d identified some food triggers for migraines, so I think it’s really a combo of both things that are successful for me. I also haven’t lost any hair, and I’m a 31 year old woman with great hair, so I would notice\n",

I didn't have a migraine for months. However, I missed a couple of doses due to forgetting to pack it when I went on a trip and for some reason, that sent me into a spiral where my migraines got much, much worse and I couldn't get back to baseline. Finally I went to a neuro and she put me on 150mg and that was a ROUGH transition- mood swings, anxiety, I couldn't eat anything, ugh. It took a while for that to level off and by then, I started noticing cognitive problems- the word finding issue was terrible, my memory sucked, I had trouble thinking. I have a very cognitively demanding job so this was not good but it did help my migraines, although I never got back to that honeymoon period of when I first went on topiramate.\n",

I’m working from home but I’m on my computer 8-10 hours a work day and started having visual disturbances and severe nausea trying to work through it. I also pretty often get “raccoon eyes” before and during a migraine episode. I know that one of my big triggers is drops in barometric pressure but this one just seems so random and it won’t go away. Since last July, I’ve taken 70mg aimovig injections once a month that have helped a ton but besides that, 10mg of Maxalt is the only thing that will knock my migraines. Usually when I take it, it knocks me out for about 12 hours and then I feel much better but I’ve taken two doses in the last 48 hours and no relief :( I also woke up with like sort of a lazy eye this morning coupled with the visual disturbances which is the first time that’s happened in my ~12 years struggling with migraines.\n",

      "Hello. Been dealing with migraines since my kid was born avout 5 years ago. Can usually pinpoint to them being hormonal and related to my periods. Lately I’ve noticed them more often throughout the month. I’ve used imitrex with success but switched to naratriptan because I was having to use more and more imitrex. I’ve trials amitryp. And was not sure I noticed a huge decrease and also gained 10 lbs but was sleeping great and felt good otherwise. Stopped due to not a huge improvement. Only took 20mg. Now back on the train of looking at a daily prophylaxis even tho I hate taking Medication and only take my abs needed migraine meds. MD recommend another trial of imitrex or a blood pressure med. I have actually lower Bp anyways so I’m not sure how this helps. Looking for insight in anyone whose tried either of these with success . I will say my migraines are not classic in nature/ they are in my occipital area and move almost through my jaw and down my neck/ shoulder. Thanks!\n",

      "I was taking 75mg at bed time my highest dosage and if I woke up in the middle of the night, I would hallucinate and it was terrifying! My biggest side effects were weight gain (I gained about 10 lbs and on a 5’4” female this felt  like a ton!) and then dry mouth and eyes in the morning. Amitriptyline did not do much for the frequency of my migraines sadly, but it did reduce the severity of the majority of them (unmedicated I get about 4-6 per week.)\n",

For some reason it has never helped me sleep at night which was one of the perks I was hoping for, haha. Did bring frequency and severity of headaches down enough that I'm willing to put up with it for now.\n",

      "Hi. I just thought I would share my experience on how I got rid of my chronic headaches which were pretty severe and were happening basically every other day on average.\n",
      "\n",
      "About two and a half years ago, I started to get mild-moderate headaches somewhat often after following a vegan diet for awhile. I didn’t think much of it at first, but once they started to get worse and happen more frequently, I realized that I needed to change something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon doing more research, I realized that my vegan diet may have been the cause of my headaches, and I decided to investigate it further and test it out for myself. Upon doing further research online, as well as testing things out myself, I noticed that it was specifically the high copper foods (which are very prominent in vegan diets) combined with the low zinc consumption in the vegan diet which were making me have the headaches (in addition to irritability, a racing mind, and a general sense of being unable to handle any stress without feeling awful physically and mentally).\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, I fully cut out the vegan diet about two years ago and I noticed that I was not getting the headaches as frequently. I also noticed that when I would consume basically any amount of a high copper food (such as chocolate, avocado, shrimp, salmon, mushrooms, soy), I would feel awful and my migraines would be worse that usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this, I still had pretty frequent headaches (maybe a very minor initial stage headache a few times a week and a more progressed migraine once or twice per week). In addition, any amount of stress, basic tasks, or exercise would bring on the migraines and they would often be severe enough that I wouldn’t be able to function well or sit through class. And they got even more frequent and severe once I started taking vitamin D (which I didn’t realize at the time was affecting me), since taking vitamin D can lower your magnesium levels (specifically if you don’t take magnesium with it) and low magnesium is known to cause or worsen headaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "After continuing to have these pretty debilitating symptoms for awhile, I decided to do some research and potentially experiment with supplements. That’s when I found expansive information on CoQ10 and migraines (and how it relates to copper levels as well) and how CoQ10 has limited the frequency of certain people’s migraines by out 50%. I also saw similar information on Riboflavin and magnesium. \n",
      "\n",
      "At that point, I started taking Nature Made brand CoQ10 (sometimes 200 mg but mostly starting with 400 mg per day) and 400 mg per day of Forest leaf brand Riboflavin. \n",
      "\n",
      "The change was shocking. Within a few days, I was barely having headaches/migraines, I was having less of a reaction to high copper foods, exercise wasn’t giving me a headache anymore (I used to previously get headaches every single time I exercised), and I was barely getting stress related headaches. My life was so much better and I couldn’t believe it. And things have continued on like this ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly wasn’t expecting results this drastic, since the studies didn’t say much about a reduction in severity of migraines, rather they pointed to a simple reduction in frequency. Maybe I’m a special case here, and maybe others won’t see results as drastic. Perhaps the average person who benefits from the combination of these two supplements will have a noticeable reduction in frequency of migraines and not a reduction in severity, which is still a life changing result. Or maybe others will have even better results such as myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "However , don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t work for you. Everyone’s body is different and each of us may have different causes for our migraines, so don’t give up hope and keep looking. And note that for these studies, they mention the results taking at least a few months to appear. So keep pushing through, please don’t give up if you don’t see results within a week or a month. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and I forgot to mention that occasionally taking 200 or 400 mg of magnesium glycinate (which is basically the only form of magnesium that is easy on the stomach) helps prevent headaches (especially if I’m currently taking or have been taking Vitamin D).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, those are my results. Basically the only times I get headaches now are if I am slacking on taking the supplements and eat too many high-copper foods, or if I take the CoQ10 immediately after eating a very high copper or high zinc food (usually if I already have a copper induced headache and decide to take CoQ10 after). For some reason, too much zinc (such as beef or dark meat chicken) tends to sometimes cause headaches for me, perhaps because it is known to antagonize copper and might cause a dumping of built up copper I have in my body from chronically consuming way too much copper when I was vegan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But don’t worry about that. I don’t want to overcomplicate things, and that doesn’t happen that often anyway and it might not pertain to any of you anyway. Simply try taking CoQ10 and riboflavin daily. I highly highly recommended trying it out. Think of it more as a preventative thing rather than something to take if you already have a migraine/headache, since it doesn’t work like that.\n",

      "Ohhh man, copper and Zinc. I recently found out from neurology bloodwork that my copper levels abnormally high, AND they are nearly TWICE as high as my zinc levels. Not good. They say you should have MORE zinc than copper, or a 1:1 zinc/copper ratio at the very most. I'm not even close.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That’s interesting and it makes sense. Riboflavin has showed great results for many people, but based on what I’ve seen, I don’t think a multivitamin has enough riboflavin to be effective. I know that the recommended high dose riboflavin (400 mg) can get expensive, so if you can’t afford that, I’d possibly recommend a B50 complex since that has a lot more riboflavin than a multivitamin. It still might not be enough to be effective (assuming riboflavin works for you), but it might be worth a shot if you’re unable to afford the 400 mg riboflavin. But if you are able, I’d definitely recommend the 400 mg riboflavin (forest leaf brand), but if you do take it, make sure you stick with it for at least 2-3 months. If that doesn’t work, CoQ10 could be an option, or you could try both. But I know everyone’s case is different so a different treatment might work for you.\n",

I took my abortive which helped end the pain but stayed nauseous for a couple more hours. My stomach doesn't feel 100% so I'm not ruling out that it is a bug but I think it may have been a migraine. Since the start of this year, I have been trying to reduce the dose of my preventative, amitriptyline. I've been taking it down 10mg a month. The first week is always really rough. I'm at the end of week 2 of the reduction. Could the reduction cause a change in my usual symptoms?\n",

That’s when I really was like ok I need to figure out how to get rid of this and I realized like oh shit maybe it’s the topamax so my neurologist had me quit and within about two weeks all those symptoms went away. It’s hard to tell if it actually helped any migraine symptoms though because the fully body numbness and brain fog side effects were so much worse.\n",

      "I was very scared at first (just based on what I had heard about the drug) but it made my quality of life so much better and I will never go back.

No brain fog, totally cognitively functional; I am doing a PhD and am fine.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not sure how low a dose you’ve been recommended, but I started at 25mg and never made it past that because the brain fog was *real*. I took it at night so I think I slept through the worst of it, but I definitely spent my mornings feeling a bit baked. \n",

      "\n",
      "1) find a new doctor. Drinking more water is the shittiest advice anyone can give, let alone a professional. She needs someone to take her seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Try to identify triggers. This can literally be anything, but here’s some ideas to get you started: correlation to her menstrual cycle; dietary triggers like MSG, caffeine, excessive sugar, alcohol; fragrance triggers like wall plugins and candles, perfumes on either one of you, scented shampoos, lotions and deodorants, scented laundry detergents; too much variance in her sleep schedule; bright lights; muscle tension from sitting or sleeping in a weird position for too long; too much exercise or not enough exercise. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) based on the ideas above, I’d suggest that the easiest thing to do is go fragrance free. Whole Foods has a good 365 brand fragrance free shampoo and conditioner, and you can find a lot of fragrance free options for body products and laundry products there too. Once you’ve eliminated scents in the home, keep a diary of periods, sleep times, foods eaten, and exercise, and over the course of a couple weeks to a month see if any correlations pop up. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) I do an OTC migraine cocktail that can sometime knock it back a bit or stop it if I take it early enough. Do a double dose of acetaminophen, around 600-800mg of Naproxen sodium (Aleve, the liquid pills work faster than the solid tablets), and a decongestant of your choice like Sudafed or phenylephrine. Have her take the three things with caffeine, like coffee or a soda. If you live in a state where weed is legal, add in a 5mg 1:1 ratio CBD/THC edible. If you don’t want to dig all these things up, have her take a dose of liquid DayQuil or NyQuil- they have a lot of the same ingredients in it. When it comes to weed, it won’t do a lot for the pain, but it will help her relax enough to sleep through the pain, and 5 mg shouldn’t get her too high unless she’s super sensitive to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m sorry you guys are having to deal with all of this! I wish you all success in finding something that works for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: you mentioned that she could be at increased risk of stroke. If she is on birth control, she needs to call her gyno now and make sure she’s not on an estrogen-based birth control. Estrogen will increase stroke risk. I’ve been down this road myself, and there are plenty of BC options that don’t involve estrogen, like Nora-be progestin only pills, the Depo shot, the Nexplanon implant, and an IUD. My experience is that the pills are good but apparently less effective at preventing pregnancy, the IUD is super easy as long as you can get used to it (i cramped the whole time it was in and had to get it out), the Depo shot was super easy and completely stopped my period but apparently I’m unusual lol, now I have the Nexplanon implant and I love it. No maintenance, it took about a week for my arm to heal, and I’m pretty much guaranteed to not get pregnant for 3-4 years. Hope this helps!!\n",

Any advice with regards to imitrex would be appreciated!\n",

I just noticed that on my good days instead of sitting around watching tv, reading, or painting I was actually leaving the house running errands, messing in my garden, or doing any outside activity.  Again, for me it hasn’t helped the migraine at all.  It has only improved my good days and made me more functional on them. On those days I seem to have less light/sound sensitivity, I’m not as grumpy (isn’t IS a mood stabilizer, of course), and mainly just able to tolerate being outside my cool, dark dungeon of a house.\n",

Some doctors are uncomfortable with this combo though, but you could also try clomipramine in place of both which is very similar to a SSRI + amitriptyline combo if you feel like you otherwise need to stay on the SSRI. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also one issue I see here in this board is that many people only try low dosages like 10-25 mg amitriptyline before giving up on it saying \"it doesn't work\", but some people need to go higher than that sometimes up too 100-150 mg for it to work well for migraines. Of course a high enough dosage of amitriptyline might also do well in place of the SSRI should you need the high dose. Btw the sedation/tiredness from TCAs goes away within a few weeks and if you get constipation you can take care of that with 1000+ mg magnesium, these are the side-effects people usually complain most about which often makes people stop taking it the first week not knowing both side-effects tend to mostly go away the first month.\n",

No over-the-counter meds work. one of my triggers is stress. how ironic that the stress that i am feeling comes from not having enough medication and it's the insurance company that's holding it back giving me stress that causes more attacks. anyway...has anyone used Nurx, online pharmacy/teleheath? i think i can get addtional pills from them. It's either get pills from online or go to the ER when i get an attack. i hate insurance.\n",

I do agree with you that 6 is unnecessarily limiting - OP could talk to their doctor about applying for a quantity limit exception with their insurance - but 6 can still be troublesome for some people. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be able to get 9, but for a lot of people it’s about the consecutive number of doses.

I can’t focus on anything, and I tried to drive up the road to get coffee this morning (literally a 2 minute drive), and half the time couldn’t remember where I was going or how to get there. I couldn’t even watch a musical today that I’ve seen hundreds of times, because I couldn’t figure out what was going on. I plan on calling my doctor because I’m concerned, but is this normal??

It did help with the migraine, but quality of life was equally crap because  I had the dumbs and couldn't brain.  At least with Sumatriptan I can function.

Even when I took it earlier in the evening, I was drowsy for most of the morning (and I'm a morning person!). My neurologist decided to switch me to topiramate, and am just waiting for it to kick in(?). But I'm so happy that I don't feel like a zombie half the day.\n",

      "Anyway- I’ve had migraines for what seems like forever- tried lots of different preventatives, and had some good success with topiramate UNTIL I got a different brand (I always get a generic brand but from different pharmaceutical companies) when I went to collect my script. I took it as prescribed, then noticed all of the weird side effects I usually get completely stopped- ok, maybe I thought I was just getting more used to them, but then I started getting headaches again, and then migraines, and then putting on weight! (As weight loss is a nice side effect lol). Anyway, I actually RAN OUT of sumatriptan (something I’ve not done in years, as I plan my life around that drug!) I was NOT happy! \n",

      "Each migraine I kind of managed as best as I could, I still managed to work. I had the MRA scan in the middle of this somewhere (tried to make sure I didn’t take any medication anywhere near the time of the scan as I didn’t want it to mess with any results- don’t even know if that’s a possibility but didn’t want to take the chance!).   Eventually I went back to the pharmacy when I could request more medication and just put in a request to never have that brand again as I was convinced it was made of sugar or something! Anyway... onto problem 2...\n",
      "\n",
      "On the back of all of this, just as I felt I was getting back on top of it all- got my weird side effect tingles back with my new meds- I got a shocking ‘thunderclap-type’ headache right in the back of my head (on the right side) after my night shift as I was relaxing in the bath. I felt like I’d broken my skull- but it felt more electrical rather than like someone had hit me with a baseball bat if you know what I mean. The pain subsided after about 5/10 mins so I figured it probably wasn’t all that serious so I ended up going to bed seeing as I had just finished work. This is like nothing I’ve ever had before- ever. The pains kept coming back again over and over again though- if I moved my head in certain directions, I’d I brushed my hair, if I touched my head- if I thought certain things- god knows what set it off! I went to the ER (a&amp;e) in the end as I was worried about the thunder clap nature and the acute onset- plus I’d vomited while I was there (this was Sunday by now).\n",

      "So in a&amp;e/ER they took bloods, chased my MRA from 3 weeks ago and because there was no evidence of an aneurysm, sent me home with dihydrocodeine, cyclizine and paracetamol and an increase in my topiramate prescription. I’m still in absolute agony though. \n",

Pregnant women can’t take other OTC drugs.  I then consulted my primary care doctor and she told me she basically doesn’t know what to do so she consulted the neurologist. Since pregnant women are prone to migraines they’re thinking it’s the fact that I’m pregnant, but migraines for me are very rare. Regardless, I told her that I really feel like this migraine is different and is related to the vaccine. She let me know that I should probably try to keep taking the Acetaminophen up to 4,000 mgs a day and if it doesn’t get better by this Friday, to reach out and schedule the MRI. I’m worried that it’s a blood clot or something else or that the migraine will never go away so long as the antibodies are in me. Please keep us updated what happens and hopefully we all get over these migraines. Must say taking 1,000 mgs of acetaminophen in one dose has really helped but after the 6 hour mark I feel the migraine creeping back in. \n",

When they come on, they last a day maximum, previously they could last a few days without meds. Also, my blood pressure has decreased and my anxiety is much more manageable.

A few months ago I was told by my therapist that I have to take Sumatriptan right as the migraine started. I tried the Robaxin but it just made me slow since it’s a muscle relaxer. I’ve found success with Sumatriptan, but I need to take two 100mg pills to not be in much pain. Though, my doctor only recommended 400mg a week, so only two days of little pain. A few weeks ago I was prescribed Noritriptyline, but I haven’t seen any improvement. They said it could take months to start working, but I can’t wait that long.

      "Hoping maybe this sub can help me.. So I’ve been suffering from migraines for years. A few months ago (maybe 6-8) I was put on Imitrex (Sumatriptan 25mg). It has been amazing at getting rid of my headaches! I think I was given 12 the first month I filled. Then noticed it was down to 9/month. I thought that was strange but whatever. So the next time I saw my doctor I asked her if she could give me more monthly since I get cluster headaches around the end/beginning of each month. So I saw she wrote me a script for 20! Great! However, the CVS pharmacist said that insurance would not allow for more than 9 a month because ‘it’s not used as a cure for migraines and if I need more than 9 a month then imitrex isn’t working for me and I must find another solution’ ...so this same pharmacist was continuing to only give me 9 a month...bummer, that’s why I’ve been getting less those months back. However, I went to pick up my script the other day and I got all 20? I noticed that this script was filled by a different person. So.. how was I able to get the 20 now but not previously? Was it the previous pharmacist preventing me from being able to fill this script?  Or did this new person make a mistake? If I was only allowed 9 by insurance then I wouldn’t have been able to get the full 20 correct? Which is why I think it’s the previous pharmacist preventing me. I’m not sure how to handle the situation, I’m just really upset about all those months trying to make 9- 25mg pills last 28 days with episodes of migraines.\n",

      "The doctor is the one who writes the prescription.  The pharmacist must follows what the doctor writes unless you agree to a change.  Now your insurance may limit what they will pay for But that doesn’t give the pharmacist the right to change what he’s giving you without your consent. The nine tablets may be related to namebrand and the 20 to generic. My arguments with the insurance companies went like this you were there to keep me healthy to work. If I have a migraine and can’t work you are not doing your job. I travel a great deal and this medication isn’t even available in the areas that I travel to so I have to travel with enough to cover me. The alternative to taking this is for me to go to the emergency room which is far more expensive to you than filling my prescription.  Stand your ground.  There is also a 100 mg tablet.\n",

The “mini pill” dosing of this progesterone is 5 mg, which is what I’m on right now- and it’s weird, it’s been 5 days without migraine for me!

My nurse practitioner wasn’t until yesterday and they called me back letting me know she wanted to start me on Topamax 25mg at bedtime for a week and then increase to 25mg twice a day after that. She refilled the Imitrex as well. I’m kinda nervous about starting the new medicine but I’m hoping it works for me.

My backup Fioricet hardly does anything either. Well, I went to the bathroom and discovered that I started my period this afternoon, and now I know why this migraine is so bad. These hormonal migraines are the worst! I'm using 2 ice packs on my head to try and numb the pain for a little bit. It should go away in the next day or two. Definitely going to get back on the Depo, will probably end up staying on it until I hit menopause I guess. I didn't have migraines this bad while I was on it.

      "Just FYI.  55 yo male.  Tried Nurtec for the first time today.  Interesting.  Still gauging results.  Have had consistent migraine since J&amp;J Vaccine a couple weeks back.  The migraine is there, just cycles down to a 2/10 or 3/10 (which I will live with).  If it starts to ramp up, I'll have a coffee or Advil (1000mg) to head it off.  The triptans all make me sick and give me a solid 24 hour hangover, so I avoid them if possible.  The indomethicin makes me loopy and forgetful the next day (like serious memory/recall issues).  So, I'm always hunting.  Was just prescribed Nurtec.  Felt the migraine ramping up today, so took one.  Within 20 minutes, made me a little nausiated (flu like).  Then, out of nowhere, felt like someone was shoving ice pick through the area between my right temple and right ear.  I've gotten that before, but usually behind the eye or right at the temple.  Although it's debilitating, the ice pick pain usually only lasts for few seconds, but precedes a migraine.  In this instance, the pain did not recede for about 10 minutes.  I spent about 20 seconds squeezing my head to try to make it go away.  Anyways, have felt a little sick, and the migraine feels like it's just being held back by a dam.  If I hadn't taken the Nurtec, I'd be doing something else right now b/c it just feels like a migraine is a certainty.  I'll re-post later to tell you how it turns out.\n",

My neuro said I need to stop using triptans because I get hemiplegic migraines sometimes and I am post menopausal (thanks hysterectomy). So he wants me to use a cocktail of 650 mg of aspirin, yup old school aspirin, Ubrelvy and a single dose of dexamethasone. He said steroids can be great to stop a cycle of migraines.

      "\n",
      "Last week, while dragging myself through a day of body pain and lethargy after taking a 100mg sumatriptan for my migraine, I searched through this subreddit for help. I saw some people were cutting their pills in half, which I'd never thought of doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yesterday evening, when I started getting some eye strain, fatigue, and light sensitivity right when I'm due to start menstruation -- clear signs of an oncoming migraine -- I took half a pill, went to bed, and woke up feeling great. When I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, I was conscious of some minor achiness, but this scenario is a million times better than what had been happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized that without thinking about it, I had been putting off taking the sumatriptan at the first sign (like you're supposed to) because the side effects were so unpleasant. Here's how last night would usually have gone: I'd try to ignore the signs and lie to myself that I'd feel better after a night of rest. The migraine would gradually grow throughout the night. At first, it wouldn't be enough to wake me up, but it would give me restless sleep. Then, around 3 or 4 AM, the pain would finally push me awake. I'd fumble in the dark with the stupid blister pack, take a pill, go back to sleep for a few more hours, and wake up feeling like all my head pain had been transferred to the rest of my body. It would be better than having a migraine, but not by much.\n",

      "Yes, 100% agree with this. I’ve read the UK prescribing guidance (not sure if it carries across to the US) and in my local CCG at least sumatriptan is just what they try first because it has multiple administration routes (tablet, nasal spray, injection) and is tolerated by teenagers.\n",

Rest up. Not only did I live to tell the tale, I never went back to the stuff. There are papers to suggest it may be habit forming so the more you kick it and stay off it the better.

I take it every day at 4pm and have seen no side effects other than my pee turning neon yellow. If you did happen to have problems with b2, you could discontinue and see relief immediately as it is water soluble and does not build up in the body. This is in direct contrast to coq10 which has a ~36 hour half life and takes awhile to build up and to clear. \n",

No one had warned me about that possibly so I just resigned myself to having new lifelong anxiety problems that I chocked up to covid-19. Turns out while I am sure my anxiety was exacerbated by the pandemic, it was absolutely worsened by coq10 horribly. After stopping, I still get slight migraine head pain periodically and still get a full blown visual aura once a week but am in much better shape with the b2, some magnesium, and PEA. The B2 funnily enough makes a huge difference.\n",

      "hello everyone! i’m writing on here just wondering if it's normal or if it’s happened to anyone else to experience a slight spike in pain when upping a dosage on propranolol, as i've seemed to experience that with both the 37.5mg dose and the 50mg dose. when starting the 37.5 dose, i had a significant headache for a few days afterwards, which then calmed and the medication was working great - i didn't get a migraine in almost 20 days, and the normal headache days i did have (around two or less a week) could be treated with regular otc painkillers. last night i took my first dose of the 50mg, and this morning i woke up with my first migraine in 20 days. i was slightly expecting it since a similar thing happened the last bump up, but i'm just wondering if it's a normal occurrence, or if i should be concerned.\n",

I know i should take it when I feel a migraine coming on, the only issue is I don’t get any aura or signs if it’s a migraine vs headache. I’m kindve atypical- It usually starts with a normal headache, and slowly morphs into a migraine on either side of my head. I get headaches almost daily, and migraines are sporadic.

      "I started getting traditional migraine with aura around the age of 9. The vestibular symptoms started when I was 22. Vertigo attacks, feeling off-balanced all the time, nystagmus, constant ringing in my ears, fullness and pressure in my ears (like as if someone's finger is plugging my ear and pulling downward, hard), sometimes I'd even temporarily lose all hearing in one of my ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctors (two ENTs, a neuro-otologist, and a neurologist that specializes in migraine) still aren't sure if I have Meniere's, vestibular migraine, or some combination of both. I had the full vestibular testing workup done (twice!) and an MRI to rule out tumors or blockages. I also did vestibular physical therapy for a couple months, which was helpful for me to physically gain confidence in movement again (I had numerous \"drop attacks\" from vertigo and after your dozenth time unexpectedly falling down on hard surfaces, you're like \"fuck this\" and you don't want to even leave the safety of your bed. I was practically agoraphobic.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since being put on a migraine preventative medication that actually works for me (extended release divalproex sodium), many of my vestibular symptoms have dwindled. The vertigo has seen the biggest improvement, thankfully, because it was the most debilitating part. At my absolute worst, I was bedridden. I had full-blown vertigo 5 days/week, 24 hours/day. I crawled to the bathroom. I couldn't keep a job or go to college. I couldn't drive. And all the anti-vertigo meds like meclizine just put me to sleep for hours, so it's not like that was helpful to living a normal life, either. For three fucking years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still get vertigo attacks every couple of months, but I take low-dose diazepam for them now instead and that helps to stop the spins quick-ish without knocking me out for hours. And then I'm still incredibly off-balanced and wonky for days after, but I just take things slowly and carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for your other questions: my triggers are weather (which can't really be helped, unfortunately), drastic changes in sodium consumption (I try to stay consistent at 1,000-1,200 mg/day), MSG, and stress. I think it does get a bit easier to deal with over time, especially if you have a good treatment plan. I've been dealing with the vestibular issues for a decade now and it's never gonna be good but... it is what it is.\n",

You could always give it a bit more time. Keep in mind that if you already eat lots of magnesium rich foods, the supplements may be pushing your dose a bit over the edge.

I have always known my right shoulder was weak and completely forgot I had injured it as a kid until they mentioned it.

This morning I woke up from an odd pain, the left side of my neck and head have been pulsating on what I believe to be my veins. It comes and goes every few minutes as a shock of pulsating pain. It's not unbearable but it's out of the ordinary and is worrisome in nature. Has anyone else experienced this after taking it a few days in a row?

I was always miserable, couldn't tolerate the noise, kids screaming, talking on the phone with a loud voice so my old grandma could hear me, etc. Then I decided to take my doctor's advice and start taking metoprolol daily (50 mg at night). It helped and brought the no. of headaches from 7 days a week to 1-2 days. My doctor also prescribed Sumatriptan to take as needed and that was helping for 2-3 months as well. Then stopped working.My headaches are usually on one side, under the left eyebrow where it's close to my nose and most of the time it goes all the way to my temple.  \n",

I’m also on Verapamil and Cyclobenzaprine for it. So far the combo seems to have been helpful in preventing a cycle (should have gotten one in February/March), but about a month ago I started getting the numb, tingly feelings in my hands and feet and from what I can gather it’s from the topiramate. Sometimes it’s in my face, and sometimes it moves up from my feet to my calves and can make it hard to walk. Tingly is a nice way to put it, as it can be a little painful and can last up to an hour at a time and usually happens multiple times a day. \n",

She warned me about all the side effects, told me what to look out for,  and I'm on a really slow ramp up process to help me adjust. The standard ramp up for migraine prevention is 25mg 1x a day (I'm doing it in the morning) for 5 days or 1 week, then 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night for wk2, then 25mg in the morning and 50mg in the evening for wk3, and then finally 50mg in the morning and 50mg in the evening for wk 4. I was told if I feel like the jumps are too soon, to ramp up at my own pace, because the side effects can be overwhelming and there's no way to tell how someone is going to react. I also might not even need the full 100mg dose to see a reduction in migraines, and I can stop ramping up whenever I want.

To start at 75mg right away for migraine prevention sounds insane to me, considering that some people have more intense side effects at just 25mg when they first start. It's an anti-epileptic drug.

I saw two ENTs, a neuro-otologist, had blood work done, an MRI, VNG and ECoG testing (which pointed to centralized dizziness, i.e. migraine-based), etc. In early December, I finally got to a neurologist who diagnosed me with vestibular migraines; her reasoning was based on how I described the dizziness, the results of the VNG test, etc. She had me start 600 mg/day of magnesium glycinate; a few weeks later, she had me add riboflavin, and then in early Feb, coQ10 was added. Since starting the magnesium, I've only had one dizzy spell, but it wasn't as bad as pre-magnesium.

      "Way late reply, but can I ask you a question? Did you feel like you're body acclimated to nortriptyline or anything? And how long have you taken it? I've taken it 15 months and love it, it's really saved my life, but all of a sudden it's as if I stopped taking it, where I definitely keep taking it every night. Completely stopped having an effect. Bizzare. bizzare bizzare bizzare bizzare. I've never heard of it. I talked to my pharmacist about it and he said maybe there's a problem and double my dosage from 10mg to 20mg and do that for 5 or 7 days. Very strange. Very strange\n",

Don't overthink things and dont worry when its not necessary, just do take some cuations. Pepto bismol and naps help if youre ever trying to get off it.

      "I take nortriptyline 20mg every night for prevention. The only side effect (and I'm very sensitive) that I had was dry mouth for a few weeks and maybe a little drowsiness at first.

      "I also told her that reflections and weird lights trigger my migraines but they are not as frequent as the “other headaches”, especially in lockdown. Still, I don’t understand if that completely flew over her head because she just went hardcore and prescribed me topiramate (25mg for two weeks and then 50mg) telling me “ohh it can cause some tingling and head confusion but it’s usually well received”. It really doesn’t look like it according to the side effects list and to some of you guys experiences. \n",
      "I told her I get around 10 headaches a month (in lockdown, I would get more when I went to school/outside) so I’m not sure if she understood that all of them are migraines or not because it really feels like a bit much to prescribe me that medicine, especially considering the migraine episodes I get are not that severe, definitely not worth the possible side effects👀. Or maybe I’m the one not understanding and the headaches I get are mostly migraines but still I really feel like that isn’t the case.\n",

I think doctors often forget to thoroughly explain why they are prescribing a medication and what the goal is.  In this case its likely to have any significant decrease in the frequency and/or severity of your headaches and/or migraines.\n",

All of that said, I have been on and off of topiramate a couple of times (currently on it) in the last 15 years. Brain fog for sure, though it has gotten better. I had tingling in my hands, but no more. No weight changes. I may have had depression issues that were worsened, but it’s hard to tell due to other circumstances at the time. Currently my mental health seems okay/unaffected by the topiramate. I didn’t know about a lot of the negative side effects when I first started this med, but it seems to help me, and I am at a high dose - 100 mg. For some of us it is helpful.\n",

      "im on emgality, and have been for two years. it changed my life and works amazing. ive now only had 2 migraines since getting on it. caffeine has always been a trigger for me. for the past few months ive been slowly seeing what caffeine i can intake with no consequences. ive gotten as far as 55mg a day and no problems. yesterday, i drank 55 mg of caffeine. and on top of that i took two small sips of my boyfriends double shot energy starbucks drink. a few hours later BOOM aura and migraine. when i had my aura, i took ketorolac. which normally works like a charm. i take it during aura, and the migraine doesnt come. BUT THIS TIME MY MIGRAINE GOT THROUGH MY EMGALITY AND MY KETOROLAC. what the hell. i then remembered yesterday morning when i woke up i turned my head quickly and had that nerve pinch feeling in my neck (which i think we have all experienced at least once). but this one was bad and hurt for like a whole minute. i couldnt move my head for a couple minutes and it freakin hurt. SOOOOO, do you guys think its possible for one of those quick head turn neck pinches to trigger a migraine? please let me know what yall think happened. because idk if it was that nerve pinch or the caffeine.\n",

      "Was recently prescribed sumatriptan after suffering from migraines for years. Was taking 50mg. It worked so well against migraines but brought out crazy anxiety, sleep deprivation, and depersonalization I have never experienced before. It was a frightening last couple of weeks even after I stopped taking it. I’m generally very healthy, strong minded and I take no other meds. I threw the rest of my prescription in the trash because I’d rather have the pain then basically lose my mind. Ending up having a 10/10 pain migraine today and still stand by that last sentence. Maybe my side effects were rare but I’d say be careful with your doses and try not to take it unless absolutely necessary and only after you’ve tried natural remedies to abort an incoming migraine\n",

      "I started on 50mg and then got bumped to 100mg when I told my neuro I didn't experience side effects. You might want to try naratriptan because it's \"smoother\" and I find it more effective than sumatriptan even because it lasts longer, but the drawback is that it takes longer to kick in. Sumatriptan is better if your migraines have a fast onset, and also better if that's just what your insurance covers without a prior authorization haha.\n",

      "I‘m getting over a really big breakup since the summer, and in late December I was simultaneously starting to feel so much better and starting topomax and aventyl. To be clear, at the beginning of the breakup I couldn’t eat and I was crying every day and and every night, but by the end of December I was waking up completely happy feeling good about myself and genuinely believed me and that person weren’t right for each other in the slightest.

When I was first sad about the breakup, these other things still made me happy, and I didn’t beat myself up over nothing: I wasn’t depressed I was just going through a breakup. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just now I thought to myself if I’m so sad all the time that it really makes sense to just not go on living, and for a minute I actually thought about how I could kill myself with the least amount of pain. Then I had a moment of clarity and I realized that that isn’t me at all. Especially before the breakup, I’m usually the happiest person you’ll ever meet, and just seeing the sun hit the sidewalk can light up my mood. Once I was starting to feel better I was definitely getting that, but I’m realizing somethings wrong and the only reason I can think of for slipping backwards like this is my medication. \n",

      "I’m on 50mg of topomax and 10mg of aventyl that I take every night, some nights if I stay up too long after taking them I get so loopy I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing when it’s just go to sleep. There have actually been a few days I’ve woken up confused too. \n",
      "\n",
      "My question is if anyone else has felt this way from topomax, and if there’s a way to curb it without stopping the medication. It’s frankly been a really good way to deal with my actual migraines/CH so I really don’t want to have to stop taking it, but I’m concerned I might actually be a threat to myself. Maybe it’s not so bad and I can catch myself before I fall too deep, especially now that I’ve put all my thoughts in order like this.

I got referred to a PT, did my exercises and this greatly helped to lessen my headaches to the point where I wasn’t too concerned with them. Over the next 6 years my headaches got steadily worse until they were occupying most of my time awake. I started graduate school at this time and started spending a ton of time at the University of Michigan hospital.

My doctor said it is technically safe as many pregnant women have been on it for both migraines and for high blood pressure in pregnancy.

But I feel like the migraine hasn’t fully gone away as I still feel it from time to time, especially if I forget to take my vitamins or if I’m about to start my period.

I’ve lost about 15-20 pounds but I look pale and unhealthy all the time, considering I was already fairly small before starting it. I’m so dizzy and tingly all day even though I drink a lot of water. I can’t think straight and I recently started stuttering, even though I’ve never had any speech problems. School is so hard for me now. I feel like I’m on drugs all the time even though I don’t do anything, and I’m still in high school so I want to do well in school. I also got acne out of nowhere after having pretty clear skin for most of my teenage years. Does anyone have an idea of how this new medicine could affect me or has anyone gone from topamax to nortriptyline? I can’t wait to get off of it.\n",

      "I was on extended release topiramate for a few years. On the lower dose the first few weeks were pretty bad because the side effects hit hard, but as I adjusted to it a lot had gone away and I just felt more tired, had random numbness and tingling, and would be achey (I think I had a few more but I can’t remember a lot of things anymore) When my neurologist started upping my dose I really started noticing some more side effects like carbonated drinks were awful and some other taste changes along with my mind being slow and I was even more tired (I could sleep 14+ hours a day). I also had trouble with memory, I would be talking and I would forget words, lose my train of thought, couldn’t remember things that happened an hour prior. My mom had noticed it and it brought up many conversations about me going off it. We didn’t want to as on the 100mg dose I hadn’t had a migraine in a year. It was amazing. But at the same time I was always sleeping, and so forgetful. I then started a new job and had ran out about a week into it. My brain cleared and I felt like clouds had disappeared and I started feeling energized and like myself. Soon after I went back to my neurologist and got it refilled and that felt like the worst month of my life. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t remember, I had trouble doing my job, I was miserable, tired, and ache. So I finally made the decision to go off it and I have now started a new preventative aimovig. My memory still isn’t back to where it was before topiramate, but it is still better than what it was while on it. Good luck to you with whatever decision you make. I hope you find relief.\n",

      "Winter 2019: I finally gave in and tried Topamax after deciding I wasn't going to start trying for kids yet (dangerous to conceive while on Topamax) and it was an instant miracle for me! Granted, the relief only lasted 4-5 months, but I went from near-daily headaches to almost nothing. After several months, the headaches crept back in and I'm sure if I increased my dose (my highest was only 50mg/day) it would have helped again. But by the time I was ready to admit defeat (Summer 2020) I'd started losing weight and hair (not clumps, but a significant increase in daily shed) and didn't want to push it with possible side effects. \n",

I see so many people here say they hated Topamax, while it actually worked pretty well for me! So unfortunately it really is a game of try, wait, and see.

      "It seems to me you may not even be suffering from traditional migraines - in which case migraine treatment would not work. You have to push for more imaging, like a brain MRI with contrast, if you haven’t already. Do your headaches ease up at all when you lay down, or get worse when you first sit or stand up? Our heads have so many important bits and delicate nerves. It seems like you need a better work up. I live in a rural area, but there are decent sized cities within driving distance, and that is where I go for my migraine treatments. A pain clinic is a good place to start if you can find one. After an initial in person visit other visits may be done by telehealth. Triptans don’t work for me, you may ask to try Cafergot it is 1mg ergotomine with 100mg caffeine.

I’m still struggling to get the regulated I’ve had to take a semester off of school. I can confidently say I was having a migraine 20 out of the 30 days of the month.

Not sure it was a part of this comment is but being on this page makes me feel a bit safer knowing I’m not the only one struggling with this daily.

      "On or around December 10th I woke up with an unusual headache on both sides of my head that did not want to budge. I got through the day with minimal fuss but the headaches remained the following day. Maybe they were fading slightly, but were pretty unusual. Along with the headaches I developed tinnitus primarily in my right ear. Ended up calling the doctor and they put it down to an inner ear infection, gave me a steroid spray and sent me on my way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The headaches calmed down over the next couple of weeks, and the tinnitus faded somewhat, but neither never really went away. I got through it with Paracetamol and eventually the tinnitus faded to a degree I could easily ignore. The headaches persisted mostly on the right side of my head, occasionally going behind my right eye.\n",

      "Fast forward to end of February and I'm trying to relax in the bathtub when the ringing suddenly comes back, and the headaches suddenly get worse again.

I'm prescribed Propranolol the very same day so I head to the pharmacy and grab them. I only take 30 mg a day but it has made a huge difference. Pain is almost gone. I only get the occasional ache now but I can tolerate that. Tinnitus remains but I can ignore it if I'm busy and usually listen to ambient sounds at night.\n",

      "\n",
      "The topamax was really helpful for me and I got used to the side effects- they’re definitely significant, though. I also used Botox to help manage my migraines and was down to about one per month.

      "I’m currently going through a multi-day migraine now (hooray for Tylenol only!) and I miss my preventatives badly. I’ll also note that topamax kept my body very slim, and after going off of it I very suddenly gained quite a bit of weight. It’s been interesting to start off my pregnancy by gaining so much weight in the first few weeks, but now it’s leveled off (3 months later). So far, the baby seems fine despite having the topamax for the first few weeks of development.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Topamax definitely helped reduce the frequency of mine, but yes, there are side effects. I was a zombie for a week or two when I started it, and every time my doc upped the dose. (I think I started at 50mg and gradually worked my way up to 150.) I took them at night only - I think it’s common to take them both morning and night? - and once I did that, it helped me sleep thru the night better and I wasn’t quite so exhausted thru the day. I did have some brain fog, but nothing like some users experience. I was on a combo of Topamax and Verapamil as prevention for probably 5-6 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have since come off both drugs and yes, you should do it gradually. I did it within a month - reduced my 150 to 100 then 50 and then stopped. I didn’t experience any side effects coming off. \n",

      "The only reason I was able to come off of Topamax tho was because I started Ajovy and it has been very successful for me. I still get migraines with barometric pressure changes because that’s a trigger I can’t control, but they are less severe and don’t last as long.\n",

      "With all due respect, there are better types of magnesium than magnesium oxide. A good one to try is ultra mag by source naturals. It’s a good blend of different magnesiums and seems to be well tolerated (less intestinal distress). The rule of thumb is 2 parts calcium to every 1 part magnesium. However, take your magnesium at bedtime, and if you’re taking calcium, take it during the day. Never take them together. A minimum magnesium dose is usually 400 mg, but I find 600mg works much better. I do believe from the research I’ve done, that migraineurs tend to have a greater need for more magnesium than the average person. I am a holistic practitioner. I definitely suggest you buy the good stuff and not the cheapest brand out there. The cheap ones will give you extreme intestinal distress and is not absorbed well.\n",

I take 400mg of B2 &amp; 400mg of CoQ10 during the day. If I run out, my attacks blow out of control within days, so I know they help.

      "As seen on the American migraine foundation website, magnesium oxide is most frequently suggested: Magnesium oxide is frequently used in pill form to prevent migraine, usually at a dose of 400-500 mg per day. Acutely, it can be dosed in pill form at the same dosage, or given intravenously as magnesium sulfate at 1-2 gm. The most frequent side effect is diarrhea, which can be helpful in those prone to constipation.\n",

      "I honestly don’t remember the first time when I was put on it ten years ago. This second time around it didn’t take long at all. I tapered up to 100mg in two weeks and noticed the effects in about that time, probably because my body had already been mostly attuned to its effects. If I can hazard a guess and try to remember correctly, it took a few months of trial and error to get me up to the 100mgs daily the first time around. I know I didn’t get there as fast as I did this time\n",

      "Hey, I just wanted to here what y'all had to say about Depakote and Zonisamide in terms of side effects and effectiveness. After getting off Topamax because it stopped working and because of me feeling uncomfortable with the shittier memory and word finding, I got on Propranolol and eventually got to 120mg ER. Propranolol seemed really promising because it worked for a decent while and with minimal side effects, and seemed to mildly help my social anxiety. But I'm not at the point of 50% migraine reduction and I actually just had like a 3 week streak of daily migraines, so I'm going to my neuro in April to switch out the Propranolol or add something to it, and Depakote and Zonisamide seem to be my neuro's next candidates. She's never mentioned the CGRP preventatives or botox, I'm not sure if she just doesn't like them or she doesn't jump to them because of insurance companies' unwillingness to cover them easily, but I'll mention those too.\n",

The worst part was, though, it like sucked ever bit of happiness out of me. It was awful for my mental health, which topomax never touched. I didn't realize how bad it was until I went on a trip and was miserable the whole time and then almost quit my job. Went off of it, threw up for 2 days and was so dizzy I couldn't drive. Now back to normal and just started doing keto and the CephalyI for migrain prevention.

My neuro has upped the dose at times (right now I am taking 100 mg twice a day) My question is has anyone experienced success with this medication in the beginning and then had it not work anymore after an amount of time?

The side effects were unbearable when we raised the dose to the next level (from 75mg to 100mg), so I ended up trying other medications before settling on a beta blocker. About two years later, I added back Topiramate but at the lowest dose to my preventative routine in conjunction with the beta blocker. Best of luck!\n",

      "First time poster, long time sufferer. I’m finally writing this after waiting roughly a week to feel better enough to sit in front of my monitor. Anyone who deals with migraines (which I gather is everyone on this subreddit) knows what I mean. Anyways, on to the bulk of this post…\n",
      "\n",
      "A little backstory info: Male, mid-40’s, Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma survivor (ok, I’ve been in remission for the past 2 and a half years), Migraine sufferer for close to 10 years, and a recent recipient of the Covid Vaccine. It’s that last part that brings me here. Because of my status as a cancer patient, I was one of the multitude that got the heads up that our condition “allows” us to get the vaccine. So last Thursday I went over to my (least) favorite hospital in good ol’ Brooklyn, NY to get poked for the benefit of not dying even faster than a relatively healthier person. It went off without much a hitch and I headed back home with an increasingly sore arm that I was warned about. For the remainder of the evening, I felt fine with no issues whatsoever.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The next day I was slated to have some dental work done. On my way to the dentist, I started getting a nasty case of itchy eyes. At first I thought that because I had walked through an area that was under construction, that I had encountered a cloud of dust, hence the irritation. Just as I got to the front door of the dentist’s office, I had a massive sneezing attack and was dripping all sorts of unmentionable material from my schnozz. I’ll fast forward to the part that might apply to everyone here…\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day forward I tried, unsuccessfully, to get rid of the incredibly debilitating reaction to the vaccine that came along with…you guessed it, A MIGRAINE!!!! What a blessing, right?! It began as a slow and steady dull headache that eventually incapacitated me. Lucky me, I had just been scripted Ubrelvy on my last visit to my PCP for my annual checkup. Despite that, the grade of headache I was initially experiencing wasn’t at the point where I felt the new script should be put into play. Maybe that was a mistake, but I chalked it all up to my body responding to the vaccine. While that assumption might have been correct, I went about dealing with the “low grade” headache with a regimen of hydration, Motrin, and finally some Benadryl to help me get through my nights, which is usually the time of day when the headaches became relatively unbearable. It became an increasing issue looking at my computer screen for more than 15 minutes, looking at the TV for any period of time and looking at my phone for enough time to answer a text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that headache went full blown turbo thunderfuck yesterday. I basically became a shell of my former self and finally shit the puppy: I took the Ubrelvy (50mgs) with hopes that it would do it’s job and hopefully fast. Two plus hours later, I felt...FUCK ALL! If it did anything, I didn’t notice at all. I had to ask my wife to go rummage through our homemade pharmacy (me and my wife both deal with autoimmune issues so yeah, we have a pharmacy in our closet) to look for the Sumatriptan/Naproxen meds that I was scripted before my insurance decided that I don’t deserve the pleasure of this combination. BTW - FUCK AETNA! Sorry...had to throw that in there. It took a few more hours for that godsend of a medication to worm it’s way through my guts and supply me with sweet, sweet relief. The only caveat to it was I shouldn’t have taken it on an empty stomach cause I'm sensitive to Naproxen. Nothing that some Ginger tea couldn’t handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I will full admit, my experience with the vaccine and its aftereffects just might be an outlier in the grand scheme of things. Everyone will experience the effects differently, if they’ll feel anything at all. My 74 yr old mother took hers like a champ and didn’t feel anything afterwards, and she’s got underlying medical conditions including migraines as well. So I guess what I’m saying is take this with a grain of salt. Nonetheless, I figured that this experience I went through is something that would help give a heads up to those “healthier” folks who happen to suffer from migraines. My advice to you all: if you’re able to get the vaccine (please do so) and worry about aftereffects, make sure you have all your usual remedies and materials at the ready. And immediately take your abortives at the onset of discomfort if you can. Although I can only speak to what I’ve experienced, I’m not going to say that this is what you will deal with as well. But I’d rather put this out there than not and have others go through things without knowing that there is a “precedent”.\n",

I've been told it's extremely odd that it doesn't make me sleepy, but I've experienced no side effects at all. It helps my migraines so much and I can tell when I've missed a dose because the migraines hit immediately. I use it as a daily prevention med and use once monthly emgality. As of this new amitriptyline dose, I'm doing great so far. Definitely worth a try at the very least.\n",

I sleep better but would not want to have to take it during the day. Still kinda have sleepy episodes 4 hours after waking. It has worked great to cut my daily tension headaches. My side effects- weird dreams, night sweats and a few body aches. I don't get as spun up over work BS, so that is a good side effect.\n",

I have 3 extra Aimovigs in the fridge because somehow I got a surplus of pharmacies filling them too much.

I had a horrifyingly painful migraine on February 18th, 2020 while i was away at college that confined me to my bed, clutching a pillow for dear life (also an 18/10 on the pain scale).

I completely agree with moderation in all things. I just like to point out that legal things like alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine are all deadly at a certain amount, at doses comparably far lower than many illegal drugs. Even water can kill you if you drink too much too fast! I personally only take oil capsules or edibles that are 10mg or less and only for pain. I never smoke anything, I don’t drink (I simply don’t like it), and avoid most caffeine (I get more jittery than a hyperactive squirrel, according to my sister lol). \n",

I have had low grade headaches and the odd migraine since, but it’s NOTHING in comparison to the way I was feeling dosing myself with different medications. \n",

Sometimes I take them a bit less and the prescription last longer, sometimes I have more migraines and they don't seem to last at all. I routinely will have a whole week each month where I have a migraine each day and have to take sumatriptan to get on with life. And then have 1-2 odd migraines each week over the rest of the month.  There are some days when it just doesn't do it for me. I have been on sumatriptan for over a decade, possibly 15 years. Before that I took Zomig for a few years. For the most part, triptans work for me to deal with my migraines when I get them. I haven't had any luck with preventative medications (propranolol or amitriptyline).

Ask your doctor.  Steroids are massive anti-inflammatories, I felt like it would release my swollen brain.  I would do a 4 day taper.  20-30mg one day then 10mg, then 5, then 2.5\n",

      "Hi! I am a 28F with chronic migraines and MS. I will start treatment with an infusion this week for my MS,  but at the advice of my migraine doctor and from some unwanted weight gain I discontinued taking remeron which I had taken from October to the end of February almost and switched to gabapentin which has been a hellish experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remeron was great for preventing migraines, and sometimes helped with insomnia. I could exercise freely with no issues with my heart rate or feeling woozy, but the weight gain (+12 pounds) on a runner was not friendly and frustrating as I run at least 6 miles a week, weight lift and do pure barre. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been taking gabapentin for 2 weeks up to 300 mg x 3 a day. This has been useless for my migraines and if my heart rate goes above 173 exercising, running, etc. I will have the worst migraine and not sleep for days and feel lightheaded. The only positive is I feel less hungry.\n",

      "I tried Gabapentin for about 3 months, eventually going all the way up to the maximum allowed daily dosage (1800mg). It didn't help with my migraines at all.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In my experience, on 200 mg now (after asking my neurologist to go off last year and somehow being pursuaded go up a dose instead!!) no. I'm so cranky and irritable all the time. It's been maybe 4 years now and it's unbearable I feel like I am trapped, and I might snap and end up in jail or something.\n",

      "Honestly I was put on topamax during one of the worst mental hardships of my adult life and it did not make my life any worse. I did notice when I dropped some weight like in the 140s/upper 130s that 250mgs was causing me to have some panic attacks and heart palpitations so I dropped down to 200mg and I am fine again. I won’t lie, I’m slowly recovering from the trauma of what I went through, but I can safely say it’s 100% what was done to me and not the medicine. I can feel the difference between my trauma and what the medicine does to me. My migraines also cause mood swings as a trigger, so it’s a wild ride all around. But just being real with yourself and knowing how you feel and why is so very important.\n",

I got up to 75mg and could not do it because i was having some mood swings in between doses.  I stayed at 75mg because i did not want to go up to 100 and talked to the doctor at 1 month.  The Doctor said it was because of the way my body was absorbing and the medication levels in my body.  They suggested trying an extended release version at 100mg which i did.  I have been on an extended release version for 3 and a half years now and been fine.  \n",

      "I say yes they do go away. I find it takes a while to hit a “sweet spot” where your body gets used to it and is at the correct dosage. I think it took me about a 6-8 weeks to get to that point. Then my doctor increased the dosage. Then we upped it again. A few months later slowly began to lower it because I lost too much weight and it wasn’t a good fit. Now I’m back at my sweet spot. I have been on it close to a year now and I have not once regretted going on Topamax. Only wished I did it sooner. I still have tons of migraines but the severity is way down and I’m living a better life. \n",

I can't drink anything carbonated at all. It all tasted flat and absolutely disgusting to me.

      "Ok y’all, I’m in a bind - I started getting migraines anywhere from 2-4 times a week and daily tension headaches suddenly last summer (obligatory no brain tumors, aneurysm, etc). Neurologist started me on 25mg of Topamax, which didn’t do much, then eventually I made it to 100mg and to about 1 migraine per week. Then as the side effects from the Topamax wore off and I got used to the meds, we realized that the numbness I was getting in the left side of my face and left arm/hand were actually auras and I’ve had to come off of my oral birth control.  I was also given Maxalt, which works for me probably 60% of the time, but a lot of my migraines seem to start as bad tension headaches and if I don’t get an aura beforehand it makes it hard for me to tell when it becomes a true full-on migraine until it’s too late. By the time I have major light and sound sensitivity it seems to be too late for the Maxalt to work really well in aborting the migraine fully.\n",

My current neurologist just kept pushing higher doses of Topamax, which I don’t feel like is helping, so I decided to switch over to an actual headache clinic that was recommended to me, but the soonest appointment I could get isn’t until the end of April.

      "I guess, basically: is it worth going through the pain of Botox for where I’m at with my headache frequency, or is it worth waiting to see if there are other medications available for me to try first? A higher dose of amitriptyline did nothing for me (still on 50mg for another condition), but other than that I’ve literally only tried the gradually increased Topamax + Maxalt combo.\n",

      "I’ve been on Topamax for over a year now. Just got bumped up to 200mg a day. I haven’t had any major side effects that made me not want to be on it anymore and I’ve been migraine free for a year now. The first month I had pins and needles in my fingertips  but that eventually went away. I haven’t been able to drink anything carbonated since being on the meds but I’m okay with that. And my favorite side effect has been weight lose. I’ve lost about 25lbs in a year. I know other people have way worse side effect than me but I have absolutely loved being on topamax so far.\n",

      "\n",
      "There is clinical data that points to success with both of these drugs, but also remember that \"success\" when it comes to treating migraine is a bit misleading.  For example, from one of the earliest studies on topomax for migraine:\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Topiramate has been studied in patients age 12 to 65 years who had an average of 5.5 headaches per month at baseline. At a dosage of 50 mg twice per day, topiramate reduced migraine frequency by approximately two headaches per month compared with a reduction of one headache per month with placebo.[2](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1015/p1563.html#afp20051015p1563-b2)–[4](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1015/p1563.html#afp20051015p1563-b4) At the same dosage, between 37 and 54 percent of patients had at least a 50 percent reduction in monthly headache frequency compared with a 22 percent response rate for patients receiving placebo (number needed to treat = 3 to 7).[2](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1015/p1563.html#afp20051015p1563-b2)–[4](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1015/p1563.html#afp20051015p1563-b4) The reduction in migraine frequency generally was observed after one month of treatment. \"\n",

      "\n",
      "So it's a good treatment option if you are one of 37-54% of patients who dropped the number of migraines by 50%, AND if you think a 50% drop in your migraines equals good treatment.  The main takeaway is that \"success\" was observed after a month.  So I would say if you want to try Topamax, make a plan with your doctor that you will check back in in 4 weeks or 6 weeks and reevaluate as to whether you should continue or try something else.\n",

The most worrisome thing about this, for me, was the almost immediate and extreme drowsiness.

I'd still mention it to your neuro but it wouldn't be my first choice if I had your type of experience with Topamax. Valproate is different but has it's own sucky side effects. I haven't been on either but I've researched them both a lot because my neuro has mentioned both as options. My first preventative was Topamax and I stopped it because I didn't like the cognitive side effects like losing my train of thought a lot and shitty word finding, both of which are big complaints on Zonegran too though even though my neuro said it's associated with less brain fog (someone on this sub also said this). I might end up trying Zonegran personally though, because propranolol even at 120mg ER is not doing it for me anymore.

This is not to be confused with the common side effect of tingling fingers caused by topamax. I literally mean like my hands/fingers/arms feel like dumbbells. I am getting over a migraine right now and as I started doing some research on this and pulled out my phone, it felt like I was dragging weights across my phone screen. I was trying to look for similar posts in reddit, and I saw something about a type of stroke which is concerning... could someone shed some light on what this symptom could be or if maybe it is a side effect of one of my medications?

After late 2015, the migraines went dormant, but then came back in February of 2020 with the same strength. I had a horrifyingly painful migraine on February 18th, 2020 while i was away at college that confined me to my bed, clutching a pillow for dear life (also an 18/10 on the pain scale). During the migraine episode in February of 2020, i also had a pins and needles sensation down my left arm and left side, which is consistent with a hemiplegic migraine.\n",

After the one in February, the migraines went dormant again until about seven and a half weeks ago when one decided to sneak up on me, this one was not as extreme as all of the previous migraines though, but it was still painful.

My neuro keeps trying to get me to back down from the 100mg I’m on but I’m terrified to go back to the near constant daily migraines I’ve been having (I’ve been getting Botox injections but I really don’t feel like they have been helping at all).

      "My grandmother and mother both suffered from migraines. My mother no longer gets them and realized she had a gluten intolerance that was causing that. I don’t eat gluten, but I’ve had migraines since I was 12. I’ve tried diets for them (Candida,Keto, Paleo... don’t waste your time on those). I’ve been Plant Based for 6 years now and while I feel a lot better than I ever have, it still has not gotten rid of the migraines. However, There is one thing that I have tried that definitely helps lower the frequency/intensity of migraines.  I’ve been taking MemantineHCL for about 8 months now. I’ve had about 4 migraines since taking it. I was getting 1-2 every month before taking memantine. The times I have gotten migraines (while they are still terrible) have been less intense, which for me means not vomiting and the migraines not lasting as long. I take about 10mg a day mixed in with a little water. MemantineHCL has little to no harmful side effects and in clinical studies it reduced the severity/frequency of migraines by about 50%... which I can personally attest to. It also helps with cognitive function. It has a half life of 60-80 hours so you definitely only need a very small amount to treat/prevent migraines. If you decide to try it let me know!\n",

Plus a bunch of lifestyle stuff - eating and sleeping at the same times every day, trigger avoidance, etc.\n",

      "Also I remember one specific night were i woke from the most painful event I ever felt, like a lightning in my head and behind one of my eyes. For a couple of weeks I kept feeling \"zaps\" behind my eyes. Due to this, I went to an ophtalmologist who diagnosed me with dry eyes due to intense pc usage, so I started using eyes drops and the pain behind the eyes got better \n",
      "\n",
      "I then went to a neurologist, had MRIs of brain, eyes and cervical spine (08/2019), blood exams etc. The diagnosis was that the headaches were due to an herniated disc, which happened due to daily bad posture ( forward neck): minor herniation on c4-c5, and minor disc protrusion on c5-c6 and c6-c7.\n",
      "\n",
      "He suggested rescue medications of NSAID (etodolac) with muscle relaxers when I had pain episodes, as well as global posture reeducation sessions to correct forward neck posture, and PT (acupunture) for muscle tension. \n",

      "After around a year of treatment, 8/2020, I had new MRIs which showed some progress on the cervical forward neck.

      "\n",
      "Neurologist said this is due to an hyper sensibilization of the nervous system, and that it should diminish and go away with time.

      "Harder episodes seems to be triggered/intensified by bad posture and anxiety. Even today I basically cannot use a computer for 15mins without feeling \"something\" at the back of the head.

That was at Thanksgiving (I forgot to pack my topiramate when I went home). By Christmas, my migraines were so bad that I was having them more often than not and they were much more severe. Before that, I only got a couple migraines that lasted for one day every month, and the topiramate actually worked really well to stop that. I wound up going up to 150 mg topiramate to get it under control but it was still pretty bad, but less frequent at least. That was 2 years ago- last year, I started taking fish oil and for some reason that dramatically decreased the severity. I'm now on Ajovy after I realized the side effects of topiramate didn't justify the little it was helping. \n",

People also complain of sleepiness after taking it, and weight loss (could be a plus but if you're already average or underweight it could be an issue)\n",

Neither are super effective personally but worth a shot since there's like no side effects and both supplements are cheap. To stop migraines that already started I use naratriptan, metoclopramide, and regular ibuprofen (two 200mg tablets). Sometimes tylenol pm to also try to sleep it off\n",

I just got kicked out of a laboratory class because my professor thought I was gonna throw up on the floor. Do y’all have any suggestions? Like I said the pain in my head is bearable, it’s the other stuff causing problems right now.\n",

Our bodies are all so different that my experience (having drug sensitivities that have me on exactly 37.5mg of sertraline) won’t necessarily stop you from trying the exact same drug combo and getting positive results.\n",

It’s more about finding the right dose. 5mg of rizatriptan it plenty enough for me and I still feel exhausted and tingles in my jaw but it doesn’t knock me out. I can still do things during my day, just sluggish. I could never take a full sumatriptan. I’d try a lower dose at first. Always eat before taking them or you will feel extremely nauseas\n",

      "I decided it was time to see a Neuro. I have explained this in my previous posts. My neuro told me that he believes I suffer with chronic migraines, but because I have been using Sumatripan daily, sometimes 300mg daily, this can cause rebound headaches. Giving me a correct prognosis would be impossible until I stripped back on all medication as he suspected I was suffering with major rebound headaches. He told me that the next few weeks would be hell. \n",

      "pity party warning: I have basically had a migraine for 3 years from a car accident (rear ended -mild concussion and whiplash). At first I was told that the migraines would eventually go away, but the migraines became much worse after I gave birth last year. Now it’s “you’ll probably have these forever” and discussions about how to lessen the pain. Every new treatment gets my hopes up, and then I’m crushed when it doesn’t work. I had Botox last month which actually seemed to help with the head pain but not the other symptoms, until a massive one busted through. My husband and I really wanted a second child (we have a 15 month old), but I’m not sure if I can handle having a second baby. But I feel like I have to because we unfortunately don’t have any family that isn’t elderly. I don’t want my son to be alone when my husband and I are gone. But then I think about 9 months of an even stronger migraine combined with morning sickness, the lack of sleep with a baby, etc. and I don’t know if I can. All I want to do is play with our toddler without worry or pain or my sunglasses on (I’m getting theraspecs soon). I’m almost 40 so it’s kind of like now or never. I’m just heartbroken.

      "Does Ubrelvy make anyone’s pain worse? I tried 50mg last night for the first time when I first started getting an aura, fell asleep and woke up with more pain than I usually get, it also lasted longer than my usual migraines. I’m not sure if this was just an especially bad one and the meds didn’t work, or if they actually worsened the migraine? My neurologist gave me a 50mg sample and a 100mg sample of Ubrelvy, as well as two samples of Nurtec, I’m wondering if it’s worth it to try the 100mg or just try Nurtec the next time I get a migraine?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Just my two cents. I would try 100mg Ubrelvy next time. The onl reason I say that is so you can rule it out confidently if it doesn’t work. I just feel like finding an effective treatment for migraine is such a journey and writing something off that doesn’t work once might lead you to have little to no options left in the long run. This is just my opinion. I take Ubrelvy and it doesn’t always work for me like Sumatriptan used to. I’m no longer able to take any triptans because of another medication I now have to take daily. So for me, my options are already limited so that’s where I’m coming from. That being said, obviously do what you feel is right. I get 10+ migraine days a month, so for me if something doesn’t work I get another try pretty quickly lol.\n",

She’s going to try Topamax next, but I was wondering if anyone had any symptoms like these and what helps? Torodol helps immensely for about 12 hours, and then I go back into a migraine.

Amitriptyline is a recent thing and has definitely helped keep my migraines under control. Prior to taking amitriptyline I was having 4-6 migraines a week with 2/3 main severe attacks. After having been on it scince around November I now have 1 or mild migraines a week and a really bad one maybe once a fortnight. It didn't really start working for me untill around 8 weeks (two weeks after upping dose to 20mg) so be patient in finding if it works for you.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If I’m completely honest with you, none of them worked. In fact, I believe that every medication has made it worse. I’ve tried amitriptyline, 100mg. I’ve tried propranolol, 50mg. I’ve tried Topiramate, 50mg. The only thing that would curb my migraine is Sumatripan. However, the overuse of sumatripan over 3 years has brought me to a point of daily headaches and migraines.. in fact, they don’t work at all now. \n",
      "My neuro recommended I come off all medication for 3 weeks to allow my brain to adjust. This has been the best course of action for me. My daily headaches are almost completely gone.

      "At first, it laid me flat. I slept all day, but I thought, maybe I just have to get through this. Each new dose, the first few days I would be very tired and just “off,” so to speak, as well as vaguely headachey (tension headaches), but that ended each time after 3 days or so as my body got used to the dose. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know how my body will react to it long term, of course, but I did go in to it terrified of the side effects but also willing to push through some initial discomfort assuming it could stabilize after a while. Well see. \n",

      "Btw—I don’t think I’ll be going up to 100mg—I read that 50 can be effective for migraines for some. My GP prescribed it because I was desperate, and I finally get to see the neurologist next week, so we’ll see what he says.\n",

I could describe the word’s meaning but not the word. For example, refrigerator. I would say, that big thing in the kitchen that holds food and has a freezer attached. Yeah. I was on the 100mg dose. It can also cause a decline in your executive organizational skills. Also, many people want to take it because it decreases appetite. The average weight-loss in studies is only &lt; 5 lbs. I can tell you that decline in appetite only persisted for about a year. Everyone is different. I also had an issue where all carbonated drinks tasted flat. I now take Namenda which is a cognitive enhancer (normally given to dementia and Alzheimer’s patients) but has been shown in some people to help chronic headaches.  It’s used off label to also treat anxiety, so it’s not like taking Adderall. In saying all this, taking topamax is a personal choice between you and your doctor. Sometimes a daily med like this is warranted. Like I said, I took it a long time because at the time the relief it gave me was more important than the immediate side effects. If you do decide to try it, I would just be aware of the side effects as most of us have experienced and make your decision. I would also recommend tapering up to 100 mg. It’s suggested in the literature but some physicians don’t feel the need. Back then I did 25 mg 1 week, 50mg 1 week, etc. you get less immediate doping side effects. Good luck.\n",

      "I’m still not convinced MOH is a thing. After 5 years working with a neurologist and being told not to take OTC painkillers while being rotated through meds with worse and worse side effects, I realized the most functional I ever was was when I was eating advil like candy. It did cause other problems, probably because I was taking 800mg 4x a day, but now I take the 400mg when I’m in pain even if it’s every day for a week and it’s still the most consistently effective “medication” I’ve been on. I did eventually find out my migraines are often musculoskeletal so that’s probably why, but yeah, how can I know if it’s MOH when my migraine cycles already last 2-3 weeks anyway.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Metoclopramide, but it isn't stellar for me personally at 5mg. Saying it doesn't cause moh is kind of a gotcha because my neuro also told me not to take it more than roughly 2 times a week anyway because of the risk of potentially irreversible tardive dyskinesia 🙃 . But it's still good to have another option on top of Ibuprofen and triptans to not use those two too much either. It's mainly an antiemetic so it should be really useful if you're getting the nausea part of a migraine, and it's safe in pregnancy. Also, the evidence of NSAIDs and acetaminophen causing moh isn't as convincing as opiates and maybe triptans. I think it's probably greater if it's in a combo drug like excedrin.\n",

I will say, however, I didn’t have any side effects besides mood swings. I was told to increase my dose of zonisamide on the last day as well. so last night I took 75mg.

I noticed that they would start only after waking up. The pain would start at the base of my head and into my shoulders and move up my head into the front. It then got to the point where I was having severe light sensitivity. Talked with my doc and got prescribed Topamax 50mg/day, that didn't help. They bumped it to 200mg/day and prescribed sumatriptan 100mg but advised against using it daily. Still with the increased daily dosage of Topamax I wasn't seeing any improvements until magically things seemed to get better, I was having good days. I couldn't figure out why, what changed? Well, I've been battling sinus issues for a few days (which I get annually living in the mid-west). So if I don't take the sinus meds and let that drive me nuts I don't have migraine issues, like literally none. But if I smell on Vicks, or take a decongestant or anything like that almost immediately in correlation to the meds working the light sensitivity starts coming back, not necessarily the migraine pain though. Although yesterday I woke up with the neckache and had a migraine again but was breathing better.   Kinda rambly, but this is all new to me. Anyone else see patterns like this?\n",

I have two friends on it, and my aunt was on it for her chronic migraines and had no issues even at 200mg. So what may be \"dopomax\" for you isn't for others whatsoever. Sorry you personally had a bad experience, so bad that you discredited my personal experience based solely on yours. I've been on it for a few years through out my surgeries (2 radio surgeries to remove a 4cm avm) and haven't had this issue since the medication reduction.

I know that this is a nothing dose compared to what many are on. However, yesterday I felt a slight burning in my head on top of my normal migraine. This morning, I woke up and my brain was on fire. I had never felt anything like it. I am already at my monthly max of Ubrelvy, so I took some Aleve and Tylenol, and ate some carbs. It kind of helped. But not really.

I try not to take the Naratriptan bc I hate the way it makes me feel. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't make me feel as buzzy as the Riza- &amp; the Suma- but it's more effective. Oh, I should also mention I'm on 200mg Topamax &amp; Amitriptyline. My neurologist always reminds me that when I'm experiencing the symptoms of a migraine, this is considered a migraine! A migraine doesn't need to be accompanied by the severe headache, that's a misconception! She tells me this so I take care of myself at the start of my symptoms.

I was prescribed amitriptyline and worked my way up to 100mg a day, which did absolutely nothing for me. Along side this, I take Sumatriptan. Sumatriptan has been a godsend for me when I need instant relief. I’m now off amitriptyline. \n",

      "Sometimes, Topiramate will leave me feeling quite spaced out and drunk at times. Now and then I feel as though the room is closing in on me, then getting bigger. But, this is nothing in comparison to the THUMPING pain I had felt previously. It felt like everyday was a battle. \n",

While using amitriptyline I was experiencing migraines mostly everyday, so I was building up my dosage to 100mg over a period of weeks. I stayed on for a total of 3 months before I gave up. I used sumatripan 100mg daily as my life saver. Amitriptyline did NOTHING for me. In fact I feel taking myself off of it has been a terrible process and has given me more clouding.

I get pins and needles in my fingers, the confusion or spaced out feeling should go away. I also couldn’t really taste the carbonated part of fizzy drinks all over my tongue, only at the back. Still can’t really taste it all over my tongue.

      "Hi!! So I have gone up to 20 mg a day because I did have a little spell there where the migraines were pretty bad for about a month. It was likely one or two really long migraines that I was able to subside with triptan but not fully break. But other than that things have been pretty good. The amitriptyline has definitely resulted in fewer migraines and also has decreased the severity. I used to always need two triptans but now I can usually treat it with one. Last triptan refill was April 26 and I have 8 left which is huge for me!!! I used to go through 12 a month.\n",

I honestly feel like a whole new person I don’t know if I really had depression and I know elevil is rarely used for depression anymore because it’s not super effective but I feel a lot better.

Neither my neurologist nor OBGYN has any idea either. \n",

The only thing that has ever helped these headaches was acetaminophen with codeine, but I have to take 3 at a time. That's how bad my headaches/migraines are.

I thought it was the answer to all my problems. Sadly after a year it stopped working. I have no idea why, if my body got immune to it or what. Over the next year we slowly increased my dose. Now I am up to 250mg, which my neuro and I agreed was probably the highest I should be on or near the highest I should be on for treating migraine. I don't understand why it worked so well on a low dose and now on a high dose, I am getting 3 week stints of migraines, headaches frequently again. It's like back to the old days again, like I'm not even on it at all. I am having to take codeine for my headaches multiple times a week just to get through the day.

      "I have also had an incredible response to keto, but I have an addendum.  I'm chronic and blood sugar swings are one of my primary triggers.  After being in ketosis for a few years with great success (it both fixed my blood sugar swings but also totally increased my tolerance for my other triggers as well),  I bought some metformin (the diabetes drug), while in Europe, because it was sold over-the-counter there. It turns out I can cheat my ketotic diet and, as long as I take a low dose of metformin, I avoid the migraine. I took this info to my doctor, who was willing to prescribe it off-label for me. I just take 250-500 mg each time I eat any high carb or sugary food and it works perfectly! I can take up to 750 mg a day (this is way below the dose prescribed for diabetics and pre-diabetics), have no side effects, and not get a migraine.\n",

I was crying a lot and I was not feeling like myself at all. Unable to be positive really. I was thinking about quitting the drug at that point but I wanted to see if things got better. The drug didn´t really help my migraines and gave me side effects like tingling hands and feet and taste changes (soda mostly). I also had a panic attack in October, which I NEVER get. I probably had one single panic attack prior to this, as a teenager, and now I´m 28. Topamax can actually cause panic attacks...

If the brain fog is this sensitive to you already at such a low dose (as it sounds like it is) and without knowing your history of migraines, I’d say it’s worth a shot (ha, pun unintended) and try Botox without being on Topamax but be sure to wean off.

Are these long term risks of heart disease or nutritional deficiencies a product of all that?  Or is it actually the diet, right?  \n",

I thought I was healthy before, but I really did experience all the good things people talk about - mental clarity, higher energy, just feeling better.  That, and it had a substantial effect on my migraine numbers.  It just felt so clear that this was how I was supposed to be (diet wise).  I've posted my story before, but the short of it was 2 years into this experiment, I bought some metformin, which is sold over the counter in some European countries, while on vacation, to see if it would help me.  It was incredible.  I take a much lower dose than is used for diabetics and pre-diabetics, just 250-500mg if I eat something carby or sugary (again, only in the afternoon or evening - I haven't tried in the mornings just because I knew that was when I was peak sensitive), and I don't get a migraine from things that would have triggered consistently in the past.  \n",

So, evening primrose and calcium but also naproxen (110mg, 2-3 days before anticipated start of period until end of period) and magnesium (10 days before anticipated start of period until end of period).

      "I've been getting mornings headaches (left-sided, pain starting behind the eye and running back thru the left side of the head) for about 20 years. At most times, I'd say 1x-2x per week. They usually start after about 5-6 hours of sleep and I can tell it's coming during the night because I can't breathe on the left side of my nose.\n",

I tried a lot: after being at my doctor's, I tried medical massage (didn't really help), went to the chiropractor (made it much worse), made a MRI (nothing special showed up) and finally got transferred to a pain clinic. I got diagnosed with tension headaches and migraine with aura. I started seeing a pain psychiatrist which helped me a lot with pain management and stress relief. I also got rolfing massages for 9 months which improved my health tremendously. Because I often feel anxious, in panic, nervous and even depressed, I got prescribed antidepressants (duloxetine 60mg) which helped me through my very stressful high school graduation. I took this drug for 15 months and decided to discontinue it at the beginning of my studies because I felt better overall and my pain had almost disappeared for months.\n",

I try to go running or do yoga regularly to balance, but my back and neck is still tense and doesn't seem to get any better. I can't get rolfing at the moment because of Covid.

A couple days after taking it, I had an 11-12 day stretch of VERY intense tinnitus attacks (a new symptom). The episodic ringing is more mild now (I started acupuncture this past Saturday, so I think that's been helpful), but this week I'm extremely exhausted and my running performance has gone down. \n",

Luckily once I've entered my 20's the frequency seems to have diminished a bit to about 4 to 6 a month and it's way better than it was in my teens surely. However, as I am ready to enter the work force and all it becomes a constraints and some of my migraines can be pretty bad with some pretty bad neurologic symptoms (I have migraines with aura).\n",

However, now that I've been on it for over 2 months at 100mgs I'm nothing that I'm really struggling to mainting my weight and not lose any further as well as my skin has been breaking out with acne that I've never had before alogn with the sensation of pins and prickles being far for recurrent now.\n",

      "Now at 100mg I'm definitely seeing side effects piling up and I'm not sure if it is worth it. I don't think I have it as bad as some others that had neurological side effects such as brain fog and memory issues, but I'm concerned with my vision and possibly further side effects.\n",

I was on the 50mg about 5 years ago and it really stopped working so I went off completely.  I would say now it reduces my migraines by maybe 25-40%.   I do have decreased appetite but for me that’s not a problem I need to lose weight.   I also cannot drink diet soda it tastes like soap.   And I have the feeling that my feet and hands are tingling but its bearable i mean its not all the time.  The worst for me is the ringing in my ears.

I have taken abortive medications in the past but I hate the weird side effects. Anyone here taken Nurtec? Does it give you that weird feeling like your head isn't attached to the rest of your body? Numbness or tingling in extremities? Does it seem to work for the aura aspect?\n",

I still get headaches but the aura aspect has changed. Before propranolol, I would get complete blindness that started in the peripheral of one eye and slowly moved across the rest of my eye into the other eye and eventually leave within an hour. Now, with propranolol, I see an increase in frequency of \"silent\" migraines where I don't have as severe pain but have bright flashes of light in parts of my vision for much longer periods of time, the longest being three weeks. I can deal with the headache more than I can having bright flashes of light in my vision.\n",

      "4. I also will use a heating pad on my neck and upper back and gently stretch my neck.\n",
      "5. If I am not feeling better I will take an NSAID (aleve or advil) and/or my abortive medication (a triptan) with a green tea. The tea has antioxidants and caffeine helps move the medications through my system faster. If i caught things way too late I will use a 70% THC/30% CBD med pen to cut down the pain.\n",
