    "I am pursuing the applied data science certificate. My programming skills are currently self-taught, and I am looking to improve them. I have also found in my career that with modern computing we tend to create substantial amounts of data, but our ability to parse through the data is lacking. My goal in the program is to better understand how to process the data and use the data to improve outcomes.  \n",

    "I was attracted to this project, an attempt to pull meaningful data to better understand migraines, because my wife suffers from these headaches. I’m also interested in learning new skills outside my swim lane. In my day job I work exclusively with numbers. Scraping the web and finding meaningful data from words will be a new challenge for me. I am sure this will teach me skills that will transfer over to my daily work. \n",

    "# Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our plan is to scrape various websites that discuss migraine headaches for discussions related to triggers, symptoms, and treatments. The internet has an almost overwhelming amount of these discussions and by pulling the data together we can create a useful dataset. We hope this dataset can lead to insights on causes and treatments of migraines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We see this project as a way to use the internet discussions to crowdsource the data. People on these forums may give their more genuine thoughts versus more formal studies. The forums are a safe place to give their feedback on symptoms and treatments. It is expected that there would be less downplaying of symptoms and a more critical eye to treatments that you may see from a dedicated study.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific data we are looking to pull includes: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Age\n",
    "- Sex \n",
    "- Common Symptoms  \n",
    "- Triggers \n",
    "- Length of headache \n",
    "- Treatments/Drugs and Dosage \n",
    "- Effectiveness of treatments\n",
    "\n",
    "The end product will be a searchable database that would give researchers the crowdsourced knowledge. It is hoped this could then give insights that could be used to better tailor treatments to migraine sufferers. By linking symptoms to treatments to outcomes, general trends can be found that would shorten the trial-and-error processes to match a patient more quickly with effective treatments. \n"

    "# Potential Issues and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "The major challenge with the data will be parsing through the forum posts and extracting meaningful information. There are no rules for posting as far as format or specific topics, so we will need to find a way to glean the key details. Few, if any, will have all the data we are looking for. Many will not have enough information to be useful, others will have relevant data wrapped in paragraphs of superfluous text. Parsing through this to get accurate and useful information will be difficult.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of one challenge is finding the sex. We plan to go through the posts and look for keywords, in particular pronouns such as ‘he’ or ‘she’. This will give an indication of the sex of the poster. But in many instances the posts are written in the first person, so the pronoun will be genderless ‘I’. In other cases, the poster may be writing on behalf of someone else and may have words like ‘wife’ or ‘daughter. This may cause confusion about who the migraine sufferer is. This will be especially problematic if we use the poster’s username to try to find their gender.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue will be in trying to parse out the drugs that are being used as treatments. The various drugs have different trade/common names and are often misspelled. Trying to associate the dosage presents challenges as well. Figuring out if numbers are relevant to the drug will be prone to error. This may be mitigated by looking for keywords such as ‘mg’ or similar common dosage units and checking to see if the number is reasonable for the drug in question.  \n",
    "Other items, such as symptoms, are more open-ended and the possibilities are limitless. This will take careful consideration of what we are looking for, what symptoms are significant enough to track. It may also require the use of a dictionary of synonyms to group symptoms into pertinent categories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other issues with the data are common to that of any data on the internet. There is no way to know if what any one poster is saying is truthful and accurate. For this topic, we are assuming that there is little incentive to post fake experiences. It is reasonable to expect the number of outright fake posts will be low. Another internet issue is people exaggerating their experiences. Our thought process here is that posters to these forums may see this audience as less judgmental as opposed to talking to a doctor or a researcher face to face. This will lead to more truthful postings. But there is no way to know for sure. The aggregate data tends to smooth out these types of exaggerations, assuming we can get a meaningful amount of data.

    "# The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We have found two promising sources of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Migraine Subreddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/\n",
    "- Migraine.com - Platform for migraine patience to share and learn about migraines\n",
    "\n",
    "We are evaluating both sources and we will pick one or we may choose to combine data from both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Migraine Subreddit\n",
    "\n",
    "Migraine Subreddit is a huge collection of posts about variety of migraine experiences like medicines used, techniques to deal with headaches, descriptions of auras, rants about people not understanding migraine sufferers and implications of suffering from migraines on work and family.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to access it.  One is via official Reddit APIs.  Reddit's User Agreement have provisions on scrapping but it allows access to all data via APIs.   For retrieving the posts and comments or even user information you can use APIs that don't require authentication.  However, our experience with those APIs is that it does not allow us to get to far back into the past posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that there is a service called [`pushshift.io`](https://pushshift.io/what-is-pushshift-io/) that maintains copy of Reddit for purposes of Big Data and Social Media ingest and analysis.  The APIs are documented [here](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/) and are very simple to use and also don't require authentication but most importantly we were able to access data from more than 2 years ago.  Therefore, we chose to use pushshift.io APIs over Reddit's own APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Migraine.com\n",
    "\n",
    "[Migraine.com](https://migraine.com/) is an excellent source on people sharing their experiences with migraine, the challenges they face, and how they deal with them.  The advantage of Migraine.com over migraine subreddit is that it is more organized and focussed on the topics within the available categories.  In addition user's post with their real names so this would allow us to identify gender of the user as an additional piece of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This site doesn't provide APIs so its forums need to be scraped.  Migraines.com `Terms of Use` specify that one needs to get permission for scraping their articles, however, the robots.txt file doesn't prohibit scraping of migraines.com/forums:\n",

    "# Intermediate Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing data either via Web scraping or APIs is slow.  For example, pushshift.io has limits on how often given endpoint can be accessed.  In order to gather 10000 posts from pushshift.io it took close to 8 hours and we needed to throttle our APIs to avoid `429 Too Many Requests` errors.  Therefore, we decided that we need a convenient intermediate data storage that would allow us to access data quickly but also perform queries to slice it and dice it.  For this reason we chose to store data retrieved from pushshift.io or migraine.com in MongoDB.  MongoDB's document data model supports JSON and it has great query language.  Since pushshift.io already returns posts as JSON objects and scraping migraine.com can also easily be returned as JSON object, MongoDB was a great fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than dealing with differences of MongoDB setup on different operating systems we decided to use Docker based approach.  Here is the `docker-compose.yml`:\n",

    "version: \"3\"\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  mongo:\n",

    "    volumes:\n",
    "      - ./dbdata:/data/db\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - 37017:27017\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We start this using `docker-compose up -d`.  Notice we mapped `/data/db` which is default location for database files to host's `/dbdata`.  This allows restarts of the container without losing the data.  In addition, we can just zip `dbdata` folder to share database files.\n",

This looks promising and we think we could use it to get gender associated with the post.\n",
    "- Reddit makes up user names so gender cannot be determined from user name.  We did find a [Kaggle project on gender classification from Twitter posts](https://www.kaggle.com/evilport/classify-gender-with-description-and-text/notebook) which could be applied to subreddit posts.  This also could turn into a project of its own but might be worth a try.  In addition, we could check text for some hints like `my wife` or `my husband` to try to help with gender classification.\n",
    "- Some of the most common topics relate to medications used, use of caffeine, sleep issues and so on.  Those look like great topics to capture.  For example, sentiment analysis of medications could lead to learning about effectiveness of medication for given condition for male or female.\n",
    "- Migrain subreddit contains sporadic rants that sometimes seem to have very little to do with migraines or don't provide any useful information.  We should attempt to filter those out.\n",
    "- There is good number of posts related to effects of migraine on personal life, work, and family.  There is a lot of good information in those posts related to depression, suicide, and mental health in general.  It would be great to filter those out and identify some patterns we could extract.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Analgesics** treat pain and include both over-the-counter and prescription medicines.\n",
    "- **Ergots** work to balance brain chemicals and constrict blood vessels. Nausea is a common side effect.\n",
    "- **Triptans** work in much the same way as ergots. However, they are more specific for migraine. Common side effects may include flushing, tingling, sleepiness, and throat or chest tightness.\n",
    "- **Small molecule CGRP blockers** are not approved to prevent migraine but are effective for rapidly treating acute migraine episodes. They are an oral pill that can be taken with other migraine drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main classes of preventive treatment migraine drugs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Antidepressants** also balance brain chemicals that play a role in migraine. Side effects vary depending on the drug.\n",
    "- **Anticonvulsants** are drugs that treat seizures through various effects on the brain. Common side effects include sleepiness and weight changes.\n",
    "- **Beta blockers.** Drugs in this class commonly treat high blood pressure. Dizziness, fatigue and nausea are common side effects.\n",
    "- **Botulinum toxins** are injected to prevent migraine in people with 15 or more headache days each month. Common side effects include headache, neck pain, and pain at the injection site.\n",
    "- **Monoclonal antibody CGRP blockers** are the first class of drugs specifically produced to prevent migraines. They block a molecule thought to instigate migraine and increase migraine pain and intensity. This drug is injected under the skin. Common side effects include redness at the injection site, constipation, or muscle spasms or cramps."

    "# Common Migraine Drugs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amitriptyline (Elavil)** is an antidepressant. The dosing ranges from once a day up to four times a day. It belongs to a group of antidepressants called tricyclics. Drowsiness and sleepiness are very common with this group, so your doctor may recommend taking it at bedtime.\n",
    "- **Divalproex sodium extended-release (Depakote ER)** is an anticonvulsant. You take the extended-release tablet once a day. Taking it with food can help prevent stomach upset.\n",
    "- **Eletriptan (Relpax)** is a triptan. It is a tablet you take at the onset of your migraine symptoms. For triptans, your doctor will tell you how many tablets you can take in a 24 hour period.\n",
    "- **Metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL)** is a beta blocker. It comes in both an immediate-release and an extended-release form.\n",
    "- **Propranolol extended-release (Inderal, Inderal LA, Inderal XL)** is another beta blocker. It comes in several forms, each with their own dosing. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about how to take your medicine.\n",
    "- **Rizatriptan (Maxalt)** is a triptan you use at the onset of symptoms. It comes as a tablet and a disintegrating tablet, which melts in your mouth without water.\n",
    "- **Sumatriptan (Imitrex)** is another triptan. It comes in several forms, including a tablet, injection, and nasal spray.\n",
    "- **Topiramate (Topamax, Trokendi XR)** is an anticonvulsant. It comes in a regular-release tablet and an extended-release capsule. You can take either kind with or without food.\n",
    "- **Venlafaxine (Effexor, Effexor XR)** is an antidepressant. You take both the tablet and the extended-release capsule with food. Stomach upset, headache, and appetite loss are common side effects.\n",
    "- **Zolmitriptan (Zomig)** is another triptan. It comes as a tablet, disintegrating table, and nasal spray.\n",
    "- **OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)** is a botulinum toxin that, when injected into areas of the face and scalp, can prevent the brain's pain response from activating. This stops migraine attacks before they occur.\n",
    "- **Erenumab (Aimovig)** is a CGRP blocker. It's given by self-injection once a month.\n"

    "We have a very rich and useful raw data in the form of text.  While this data contains great amount of information it is in text format and getting it into structured dataset will be a fun and challenging task.\n",

    "We performed number of manual analysis of samples of this data as well as some automated topic analysis.  We also run POC for getting more detailed information about the specific topic of migraine medications.  This allowed us to understand the potential and challenges of dealing with raw text.  For example, from medication analysis we learned that Spacy library is very useful in retrieving information from single sentence, however, most articles are not describing the medication in single sentence but rather couple sentences.  Now we understand that going forward we will need to create some regex based filters and other techniques to narrow down to just these sentences related to medication description.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned that we will need to use ensemble of techniques to retrieve information from the articles.  Some parts will focus on retrieving information on medications, others on author's gender, others on dosages, and so on to finally put all of that together in a simple structured data that can be easily represented and digested."
