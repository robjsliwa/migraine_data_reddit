On top of that my boyfriend said there was a small bump that developed upon injecting. He’s been injecting me for a year and a half now and hasn’t ever not done it right. He said he pressed the base to my skin like normal but it seems like the needle didn’t go far enough in and instead just injected the fluid into the dermal layer.

My mother in law seems to either not understand the intensity and severity of certain smells causing me very intense migraines. With it being colder outside my mother in law and father in law have been staining wood and spray painting different things that they sell. Me and my husband currently live with them as we can not financially afford a place of our own just yet, and there are almost no houses in a price range that we could afford sooner rather than later. \\n\\nMine and my husbands “living room” is in a room within the basement, so if they were to do something in the basement I could just go to my room on a different floor in the house to get away from the smell. However, they like to leave the door to the basement from the kitchen open on occasion and it causes the rest of the house to smell of spray paint or stain as the basement does not have a way to vent out the air. Other times they choose to stain wood in the kitchen. When they stain in the kitchen I can remain in my living room in the basement but I am unable to go get myself food or go up to our room without holding my breath the entire time, which just isn’t possible. \\n\\nMy husband mentioned the issue to his mom and she pretty much told him that there’s nothing she can do about it. I’m stressed because this is something that happens without any warning to me so that I can know to stay in certain rooms and I can’t fully avoid it. I need to be able to eat and get a drink throughout the day and sometimes it’s just not possible, so a migraine is going to appear one way or another. His mother doesn’t seem to understand how serious it is, I’m working on figuring out whether or not this new medication is working for me so with the off and on smell triggers it’s hard to tell, and it leads me to feel like she just doesn’t care even though she knows my migraines result in often ER visits if I can’t keep them under control to a certain extent. \\n\\nThe basement has also been smelling of smoke recently with is another big trigger for me. It didn’t ever use to smell of smoke when they used the wood burning stove upstairs but now it does, and my mother in law and father in law aren’t doing anything the get it checked out and fixed. \\n\\nIt just sucks and I really needed to just let it out and say that it really sucks when people don’t seem to care how they are affecting your health. We don’t currently pay rent, and since we can’t just move out as I’m not currently working ( I had to quit my job a few months ago due to some unfortunate situations so me and my husband had decided it was best for me to just pick up more classes and focus on school so that I can finish and get a better job sooner) we feel like we don’t really have any options of trying to get them to take it more seriously or forcing something to be done about it. \\n\\nSorry for the rant...',\n",
