My thinking is more impaired than usual and my blood pressure is 150/111. I need to call out sick from work but I'm so afraid of getting in trouble. I'm afraid to go to hospital emergency room with the number of COVID cases in my area. I don't know what to do.\", 'Hey y’all, I got a referral for a neurologist and while I’m waiting on it, I’ve decided to trial another preventative. I’ve tried Topomax (was on it 2 weeks, couldn’t handle the side effects), currently on Sandomigran (been on it for 19 months, stopped working 9 months in but I continued w it because I didn’t want to accept it wasn’t working 😭 when it did work, it was bloody amazing. While I can increase the dosage for effectiveness, I can barely handle the fatigue it gives). \\n\\nI have asthma and take venlafaxine for depression &amp; anxiety btw. My GP said this means my options are more limited for preventatives. \\n\\nAny suggestions for preventatives?? I’ll check if my GP is happy to prescribe. TIA :))', 'It’s day two night two of a migraine. I’ve maxed out on my Ubrevly and am just angry. I don’t want to go to the hospital because I have underlying health conditions and there’s Covid. Just needing to vent before I try to fall asleep.', 'I am in a fucked position. I have had migraines everyday for last 4 months after playing football and getting a concussion. I am in the process of scans, neurosurgeons and specialists. I’m the one thing I found helped was when a friend of mine sent me some Weed cookies. I had no pain. But next day woke up in pain again. So last week I sourced some weed to help as I am in so much pain and seriously over it. Problem is 6 years ago I went to rehab for drugs and gambling. My boyfriend went through the shit with me And seen me come so far. He is not happy I have weed, but I am not in pain. He is making threats of me having to choose. I don’t know what to do. We have been together 10. years I love him, But I don’t want to be in pain? I know I am going to have to go back to being in pain cause I don’t want to loose my relationship? Help 🥺', '', \"Hi everyone, I'm new here (44f). First I'll say, I have contacted my doctor about this event but curious to hear if this sounds familiar to anyone else.   My doc is referring me to a neurologist, but said it could take months.  He is going to talk over some options in the meantime with me.  I apologize in advance for the incoming wall of text.  \\n\\nAnyhow, I decided to check into some migraine resources after this past weekend.  On Friday, I had a headache that slowly got worse throughout the day and didn't respond to tylenol or Aleve.  By evening, I began throwing up until every little speck was out of my stomach. The headache had become absolutely throbbing and I got pulsatile tinnitus (heartbeat or wooshing like sound) in one of my ears, and the sinus on that same side became really stuffy. I had some dissolving zofran on hand, so I took that and laid very still with my eyes covered until the zofran took effect and I was able to stop vomiting.  I'd say the headache peaked at about a 7-8.  The headache lessened somewhat by Sat morning but I've had it on and off, along with the pulsing tinnitus.  It seems like my headaches and tinnitus are worse when I'm laying down, worse by morning, lessens throughout the day, then starts to creep back in in the evening.  I have been experiencing brain fog and the feeling like I can't think straight and I've been super tired.\\n\\nBefore this happened, I had had one migraine a couple of years ago where I got a terrible headache and like a wavy overlay on my vision.  Last summer, I started experiencing fatigue, terrible brain fog, and memory issues. I would have fatigue flare ups every few weeks for about 8 months.  I started on an antidepressent and it has helped somewhat, although I still experience the symptoms, they are not as bad as they were initially.  Over the past year or so, I have also had frequent headaches that I thought were related to my often stuffy left sinus.  Last March I saw a doctor because I had a period where  I had pulsatile tinnitus for a few weeks, but not like I have had this past few days.  When I saw the doc for the PT before, she had an MRI done on my carotid and that was fine.  She suggested maybe migraines but I completely blew that off. Silly me.\\n\\nDoes this sound like a migraine? More specifically, I'm curious about the pulsatile tinnitus and if it's a recognized aspect of migraines? It really freaked me out.\", 'My brain feels like it’s sloshing inside of my head and hitting parts of my skull as I move 😍 I’m gonna throw up', \"I have always had a very small problem with my hands shaking a little but since my first migraine my hands have begun shaking very bad.\\n\\nA lot of the time I struggle holding things, I'm always dropping my phone, I can spill my drinks while walking matter how slow and stable I try to be and I need to use bigger bowls when I eat \\n\\nIm always having to consider it when buying and using everything\\n\\nDoes anyone else have this problem?\", \"I've been migraine free since March after starting ADHD meds. It's been a dream come true after suffering monthly for 10+ years. Due to some insurance issues, I couldn't make my last visit and get my meds refilled. I've gotten my first migraine in months, and I forgot just how awful it is. I cried and asked to be unalive. The triptan side effects suck. I never wanted to be here again and I can't stop crying. Just needed to rant.\", 'I’m having an incredibly painful migraine right now. It’s not even accompanied with the usual dizziness, nausea and visual issues; but it’s one of the most painful migraines I’ve had in a while. I took some meds a few hours ago and all it did was move to one side of my head, and it’s still just as painful. Is there anything that helps you guys with your migraines when meds and sleep don’t work? I’m 16 and only a few weeks into school and have missed around 5 days already due to my migraines. I really don’t want to miss another day of school because of this']\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Analgesics** treat pain and include both over-the-counter and prescription medicines.\n",
    "- **Ergots** work to balance brain chemicals and constrict blood vessels. Nausea is a common side effect.\n",
    "- **Triptans** work in much the same way as ergots. However, they are more specific for migraine. Common side effects may include flushing, tingling, sleepiness, and throat or chest tightness.\n",
    "- **Small molecule CGRP blockers** are not approved to prevent migraine but are effective for rapidly treating acute migraine episodes. They are an oral pill that can be taken with other migraine drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main classes of preventive treatment migraine drugs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Antidepressants** also balance brain chemicals that play a role in migraine. Side effects vary depending on the drug.\n",
    "- **Anticonvulsants** are drugs that treat seizures through various effects on the brain. Common side effects include sleepiness and weight changes.\n",
    "- **Beta blockers.** Drugs in this class commonly treat high blood pressure. Dizziness, fatigue and nausea are common side effects.\n",
    "- **Botulinum toxins** are injected to prevent migraine in people with 15 or more headache days each month. Common side effects include headache, neck pain, and pain at the injection site.\n",
    "- **Monoclonal antibody CGRP blockers** are the first class of drugs specifically produced to prevent migraines. They block a molecule thought to instigate migraine and increase migraine pain and intensity. This drug is injected under the skin. Common side effects include redness at the injection site, constipation, or muscle spasms or cramps."

    "# Common Migraine Drugs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amitriptyline (Elavil)** is an antidepressant. The dosing ranges from once a day up to four times a day. It belongs to a group of antidepressants called tricyclics. Drowsiness and sleepiness are very common with this group, so your doctor may recommend taking it at bedtime.\n",
    "- **Divalproex sodium extended-release (Depakote ER)** is an anticonvulsant. You take the extended-release tablet once a day. Taking it with food can help prevent stomach upset.\n",
    "- **Eletriptan (Relpax)** is a triptan. It is a tablet you take at the onset of your migraine symptoms. For triptans, your doctor will tell you how many tablets you can take in a 24 hour period.\n",
    "- **Metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL)** is a beta blocker. It comes in both an immediate-release and an extended-release form.\n",
    "- **Propranolol extended-release (Inderal, Inderal LA, Inderal XL)** is another beta blocker. It comes in several forms, each with their own dosing. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about how to take your medicine.\n",
    "- **Rizatriptan (Maxalt)** is a triptan you use at the onset of symptoms. It comes as a tablet and a disintegrating tablet, which melts in your mouth without water.\n",
    "- **Sumatriptan (Imitrex)** is another triptan. It comes in several forms, including a tablet, injection, and nasal spray.\n",
    "- **Topiramate (Topamax, Trokendi XR)** is an anticonvulsant. It comes in a regular-release tablet and an extended-release capsule. You can take either kind with or without food.\n",
    "- **Venlafaxine (Effexor, Effexor XR)** is an antidepressant. You take both the tablet and the extended-release capsule with food. Stomach upset, headache, and appetite loss are common side effects.\n",
    "- **Zolmitriptan (Zomig)** is another triptan. It comes as a tablet, disintegrating table, and nasal spray.\n",
    "- **OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)** is a botulinum toxin that, when injected into areas of the face and scalp, can prevent the brain's pain response from activating. This stops migraine attacks before they occur.\n",
    "- **Erenumab (Aimovig)** is a CGRP blocker. It's given by self-injection once a month.\n",

Is this normal as I was expecting my sex drive to be lower particularly as I’m getting drier. Im not currently having sex because I’ve been so unwell for ages so not sure how my new sex life will be on the propranolol. Anyone else experience this?\n",

      "Does anyone else have migraines at the same time every day? My migraines started when I was about 9-10 years old. They didn't happen very often then, but they'd start with an aura, blacking half of my vision out and they'd quickly turn into painful headaches, nausea, light and sound sensitivity and would only go away with medication and a long nap. They've become more frequent since then, I'm now 21. it's strange, I have a migraine, every day at the same time for about two weeks, then they'll just stop for about two weeks. I'll have a migraine or two during those two weeks and then the cycle will start again. Sometimes they're at 11, and then the next cycle they could be at 1. But they're usually about the same time every day. Stiff neck, nauseating migraines that just completely put me out for the day. I have been diagnosed with chronic migraines, I was prescribed Rizatriptan but it made me feel so drunk I couldn't even lify head and it did nothing for my headaches. Now I've been given Propanol to take daily to prevent them, it doesn't work. They come without fail. I went through a long period when I was 14-16 where Drs we're confused with what I had. Constant neurology/oncology visits testing me for everything from cancer to lupus. Multiple MRIs. They never found a thing. Not even anything related to my headaches. Have any of you experienced something like this?\n",

      "I started depakote (aka valproic acid or Divalproex) at the beginning of July and FINALLY saw some improvement in my migraine symptoms after a failed 3 months on Topamax (I know lots of people who’ve had horrible experiences with topamax- I didn’t personally but stopped taking it because it didn’t help my symptoms). Anyways- it significantly decreased my number of migraines (I’ve had them chronically for 10 years) and the side effects weren’t anything severe. Main side effects are weight gain due to increased appetite, and infrequent menstrual cycles, which my doctor wasn’t concerned about because I’m on birth control and can stand to gain some weight. Unfortunately, over the past couple weeks it seems my migraines have gained the ability to adapt and change in order for the medication to stop working (I swear they have a mind of their own lmao). Now it’s back to the drawing board and I’m feeling discouraged all over again. I’d like to say that I’ve learned how to push through the bad days- but I’m starting to have to miss school days because of it (again). Has anyone else tried this medication or just have any advice?\n",

I dont recall how it made me feel the first few weeks.  But it doesnt have any weird side effects for me now.\n",

      "--------------------------------\n",
      "Eletriptan is the only one I’ve tried, and I’ve been using it for 5 years. My side effects are that it makes me pee a lot, and it irritates my stomach. It’s about 75% effective on my migraines, sometimes I have to take an OTC as well.\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "I’m currently on daily 40mg of Propranolol because the frequency and intensity was just getting too much to spot-treat.\n",

      "--------------------------------\n",
      "That's my first and only triptan I've tried, I like it. My doc said most people tolerate it pretty well. I don't think I feel any side effects from it, or at least any that I noticed while having a migraine. Maybe a little bit of drowsiness at most. I'm usually sensitive to medications in general. Of the last 5 times I took it, it aborted all of them successfully except for one. I also have a bad habit of taking it late in the attack so it's pretty good. The one time it didn't abort (a few days ago) I got relief for 10hrs before it came back. Then again, that migraine is extra persistent so it wasn't much of a surprise that it didn't abort.\n",
