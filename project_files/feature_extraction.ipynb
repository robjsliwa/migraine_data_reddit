    "# Feature Extraction Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Different features needed somewhat different approach to retrieving them from the posts and comments.  However, there is general workflow that we used for working on all of the features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of the data is that authors write in multiple posts and comments.  The main goal is to scan through these posts and identify features for each author.  Different features can come from author's different posts.  For example, in one post author can be speaking about something that identifies their gender and in another post about something that identifies their age.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture all the features we create index where author is the key and value is a dictionary of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find sentences that describe feature we are looking for.  We do this by first identifying some keyword and filtering posts by that keyword and than taking random sample from that list.\n",
    "- Once the list of sample sentences that represent feature is created, we build set of regex expression to identify all of the language patterns that the feature can be expressed with.\n",
    "- With both sample sentences and regex expressions we build function that can identify the feature given text.  To ensure that the function works correctly we create unittest and use sample sentences as input for the unittest.  This saves us time from debugging later on large dataset.\n",
    "- Finally, we run feature extracting function again entire dataset and update author index with found features."
