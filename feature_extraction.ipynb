       "  'Text': 'So I began having migraines around the age of 13 (currently 32f) and they pretty much followed the same pattern: bright colors across my vision, the occasional partial loss of vision and those nice strobing lights, soon followed by the familiar pounding pain. No medical reason was discovered, but MRIs ruled out tumors and the like. As I got older they went from daily to monthly and then gradually stopped. I was migraine free for almost 10 years.\\n\\nThen came 2021. I had a strange migraine early this year where one of my eyes just seemed to stop working for no conceivable reason. This lasted about an hour and was not followed by pain. I saw the doctor the same day, they ruled out stroke and sent me home to rest. A few months after, I began to get migraines more similar to what I experienced when I was a teen with the added \"bonus\" of nausea/some vomiting. They have gradually grown in frequency to the point where I now have around 2 per month and they last 4-5 days without relief. I am seeing a neurologist who took an MRI and said there was nothing wrong with my brain, so she started me on 16mg Candesartan to prevent them and a triptan. I am now on my third triptan (frovatriptan, have not yet used it) because the first two (sumatriptan and rizatriptan) did not stop the migraines. \\n\\nMy concerns are this: In your experience, should a triptan stop the migraine and associated pain or do they just dull the pain a bit? I\\'m afraid my expectations of the pain stopping are unrealistic, but I\\'m not sure.  Ideally, I\\'d love for the vertigo and visual disturbances to stop too, but at this point I think that may be a lost cause. \\n\\nAlso, should I be pushing my neurologist to help me discover the underlying cause? She seems unconcerned since the MRI didn\\'t show any issues, but I feel like these migraines returning out of nowhere is a bit concerning.  I should add that now even when I am not having pain, I still see the visual disturbances near constantly and have a sensitivity to light and smell.\\n\\nHappy to provide any additional info, I\\'m almost at my wit\\'s end and could use some advice.',\n",

To me, it was a choice between my stomach and my head. I kept taking NSAIDS to treat my migraines. My stomach would absolutely kill me. It got to the point that I couldn't eat any acidic foods whatsoever. I was taking nexium and drinking bottles of liquid antacids just to be able to function. In my mind, I could function with my stomach issues but I absolutely could not function with migraines. Fast forward 10 years. I got to the point that I couldn't eat solid food. I lost over 100 pounds in a year. I lost the last 45 pounds in a month. (Full disclosure: I'm 5'11. I've always been pretty large. Normally I'm between 280 and 320 pounds. All the women on my mom's side are very large, but I digress.) On May 25, 2017 I knew my heart was in arrhythmia all day. I felt my heart skipping beats but I didn't was to worry my husband. By the time he got home at 5pm, I couldn't stand. He asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital and I emphatically said no. I began talking out of my head and not making any sense. He called 911. I was rushed to the hospital. I was down to 135 pounds. You could see every bone in my body. In the last 6 weeks before this, I could only keep down water and popsicles. They transferred me to the ICU. My potassium was so low my heart was in arrhythmia, my blood sugar was 45, and my kidneys were completely shut down. The doctor told my husband had he not forced me to go to the hospital, I would have been dead by the next morning. They had to pump me with 12 bags of potassium to get me out of the danger zone. (Potassium is like liquid fire going through your veins. To this day I have no feeling on the back of my arms.) They pumped me up with glucose. I was in the ICU for 48 hours and in the hospital 8 days that time. They put a stent in my duodenum to try to keep it open because it had closed with scar tissue from my ulcers. The stent failed after a month. They put in another one. It failed after a month. I had to check myself back into the hospital because my duodenum closed again. Finally they did a gastrojenuostomy bypass. They took the second part of my small intestine and stapled it to the back of my stomach so food could exit through there. I was in the hospital 7 days that time. It took 7 weeks to recover. I can never take NSAIDS again. I'm on maxalt for my migraines now. Please just be careful.\",\n",

I've always had an aura, which used to fade and then an intense migrain pain would kick in, sending me to bed for two days. Now, I'm on my late twenties. And every so often I just get the aura with no pain. It starts off as a pinprick of static in my vision, then spreads into a big curved line, like the edge of a circle, until it fills the eye, then keeps getting bigger until it goes this lasts for about 30 mins. I didn't have one for three years, and have had two in the last two months, so I've rang my gp and waiting for a call back. When it happens I get incredibly anxious, and have to keep myself calm or I will go into a full blown panic attack. After it goes I have a very mild headache, and feel tired and run down, but honestly think that's more to do with the anxiety it enduces rather than the aura. I just want to know what others experiences are with this, do others get aura migraine without pain? Has anybody figured out any triggers, or ways to help prevent it? As I've never figured out my trigger but think it may be stress. And does anybody have advice for dealing with the anxiety it causes? Today I sat in the bath with the lights off until it went, which helped my anxiety a bit, but I worry I'll get one when I'm in work or driving.\",\n",
