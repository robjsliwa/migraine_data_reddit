I have since stopped taking it (abruptly, no withdrawal experienced) and my migraine hasn't returned.  \\n\\nWhen on Pizotifen I noticed some daytime sleepiness and a gradual (yet modest) increase in appetite (well actually, it wasn't as if I wanted to eat more, just that what I did eat didn't seem to fill my up as it should).  However, one thing that I did notice immediately though was the drastic alteration of my dreaming.   \\n\\nGenerally my dreams are short, colourless garbled nonsense and are difficult to recall.  Not so with Pizotifen!  For the entire first week of taking it I was treated to dreams unlike any I've ever experienced before.  Epic dreams; detailed and completely believable, furnished with plots and sub-plots involving complex locations with consistent elaborate features all of which I could recall near-perfectly on waking.  It became something of a joke between me and my girlfriend (who was obliged to listen to my tales of adventure in exotic places) that if ever a drug was needed to cure writers-block Pizotifen and a good nap would be it!\\n\\nI never experienced any nightmares (and due to the duration and realism of dreaming on Pizotifen I’m glad I didn’t!)  These dreams gradually faded over the first 7-10 days.\\n\\nIn retrospect, if my migraine returned I wouldn’t hesitate to take Pizotifen again, it worked well for me.\",\n",

       "  'Text': \"I am amazed and horrified to find that this drug is still being handed out to people with out proper supervision and advice.  My husband was prescribed the drug a few years ago by his G.P. as his migraines had become more frequent, due to stress at work etc.  He changed from someone who had little trouble getting up for work to a groggy, bleary eyed creature. Over the next 12 months he became increasingly belligerent, aggressive and unbearable to be around. He also experienced almost permanent numbness down his left side, like a mini stroke. I was just at the point of leaving this dark, brooding monster who was the antithesis of the funny, loving, intelligent man I married, when it occurred to me that this personality shift had taken place since he'd been taking this drug. Having picked one of his better moments to talk about this, he decided to stop taking the drug to see what happened. Within 24 hours my beloved husband was back. I got hold of the drugs and the information leaflet contained within it and realised that almost every side effect listed applied to my husband. Having been back to the G.P. together to discuss the effect this dreadful stuff had, she thought he should still take it and take anti-depressants as well, no thankyou. \\nI had always suspected that many of his migraines were triggered by low blood sugar, no breakfast, missing lunch etc. and now he has adopted regular eating patterns in combination with the herbal remedy Feverfew he has only had two migraines in the last year. We were told subsequently by yet another G.P. at the practice that Pizotifen is only supposed to be prescribed for people with debilitating seratonin triggered migraines, that it is a drug of last resort for people who cannot function on a daily basis due to persistent attacks. He also pointed out that not only should it never been given to someone with the level and type of migraine he had, but also as he drives to work every day he should never have been prescribed this drug as it renders you unfit to drive or operate machinery, which the original G.P. should have known but never mentioned. . Thank goodness he didn't come to harm or cause any!!! We  recently came across a couple pulling their hair out over their migraine suffering teenage son. He has recently been prescribed Pizotifen and has become so awful that they were considering throwing him out. We couldn't believe that it was happening to someone else and hence I searched out this site. It is a seratonin inhibitor. So unless you have migraines every day and you can't have any kind of life because of them find another treatment. Believe me when I say don't take this drug, not if you love your family.\",\n",

I suffer with daily migrains, usually 8 a day until i am in so much pain I can't move (doctor thought I had a bleed in my brain). Was put on Pizotofen. It stopped the migrains within 6 weeks and I was elated. UNTIL, my mood got completely out of control. I started to get seriously angry and wouldnt speak to anyone. My husband was my main target, but, at one point, I almost hit someone over the head and I wanted to kill anyone who looked at me. I had huge fights with my hubby and then had him arrested, even though it was me hitting him, he NEVER laid a finger on me. I told my mother that I hated her and started fights with complete strangers. In the end I took a massive overdose.  Obviously I survived, but I have done irreperable damage to my heart. I nearly lost everything because of this drug. It was the worst time of my life and I hate myself for taking it. My husband has stuck by me, but as I am writing this, he has read it and is sitting here in tears at the memory of that dreadful time. It took over a year for the drug to get out of my system and I never recovered from the deep depression that I suffered and have been put on Prozac now. NOTHING is worth taking this drug for. \\nYou should try it, it does work very well for some people, but be VERY aware of this side effect and if your loved ones notice any negative change in your personality stop it immediately, no hesitation.\",\n",

       "  'Text': \"My husband has been using Immigran (Tryptan) nasal spray for 2-3 times a week for 6 years.  He gets them on prescription, so they currently cost £6.85 for six.  He seems to think that is quite good value, but I don't know how much they cost otherwise.  I think you can only get them on prescription.\",\n",

Before i took it i suffered bad migrane attacks and when i miss tablets for a few days i have a constant headake. I do exsperiane most of the side effects i have an increaced apetite but i have learnt to controle it, dizzyness and a lighthead occationaly and i do have pains in my muscles especily my legs muscles.
